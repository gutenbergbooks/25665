<h2>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>


<p>Captain Mayne Reid was born at Ballyroney, County Down,
on the 4th April, 1818, and was the son of the Rev. Thomas
Mayne Reid. Mayne Reid was educated with a view to the
Church, but finding his inclinations opposed to this calling, he
emigrated to America and arrived in New Orleans on January,
1840. After a varied career as plantation over-seer, school-master,
and actor, with a number of expeditions in connection
with hunting and Indian warfare, he settled down in 1843 as a
journalist in Philadelphia, where he made the acquaintance of
Edgar Allan Poe.</p>

<p>Leaving Philadelphia in 1846, he spent the summer at Newport,
Rhode Island, as the correspondent of the <i>New York Herald</i>,
and in December of the same year, having obtained a commission
as second lieutenant in the 1st New York Volunteers, he sailed
for Vera Cruz to take part in the Mexican war. He behaved
with conspicuous gallantry in many engagements, and was
severely wounded and disabled at the storming of Chapultepec
on the 13th September, 1847.</p>

<p>Returning to the United States in the spring of 1848, he
resumed literary work. But in June, 1849, he sailed for
Europe in order to take part in the revolutionary movements
going on in Hungary and Bavaria, arriving however too late, he
turned his attention again to literature, and in London in 1850,
published his first novel &ldquo;The Rifle Rangers,&rdquo; in two volumes.
Between this date and his death, he produced a large number
of volumes, which indeed no one else was capable of writing,
for in them are avowedly embodied the observations and
experiences of his own extraordinary career.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunate building and journalistic speculation and enterprises
involved him in financial failure, so he returned to New
York in October, 1867. There he founded and conducted <i>The
Onward Magazine</i>, but owing to recurring bad effects of his old
Mexican wound, he had to abandon work for sometime and go
into the hospital, on leaving which he returned to England in
1870. During the later years of his life he resided at Ross in
Herefordshire where he died on the 22nd October, 1883, and was
buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.</p>

<p>Mayne Reid wrote in all thirty-five works, chiefly books of
adventure and travel. As in the case of all authors, the books
vary much in merit, but most of them are of a high order in
their own department of literature. Many of them have been
extraordinary popular and have become standard works. Reid
has not been surpassed by any other writer in combining at one
and the same time, the features of thrilling adventure and great
instruction in the fields of natural history. Many of the works
have been translated into Continental languages and are as
highly esteemed among the French and Germans as at home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class="cap">THE FUR COUNTRIES</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">B</span>oy reader, you have heard of the Hudson's Bay Company?
Ten to one you have worn a piece of fur which it has provided
for you; if not, your pretty little sister has&mdash;in her muff, or her boa, or
as a trimming for her winter dress. Would you like to know something
of the country whence come these furs?&mdash;of the animals whose backs
have been stripped to obtain them? As I feel certain that you and
I are old friends, I make bold to answer for you&mdash;yes. Come, then!
let us journey together to the &ldquo;Fur Countries;&rdquo; let us cross them
from south to north.</p>

<p>A vast journey it will be. It will cost us many thousand miles of
travel. We shall find neither railway-train, nor steamboat, nor stagecoach,
to carry us on our way. We shall not even have the help of a
horse. For us no hotel shall spread its luxurious board; no road-side
inn shall hang out its inviting sign and &ldquo;clean beds;&rdquo; no roof of any
kind shall offer us its hospitable shelter. Our table shall be a rock, a
log, or the earth itself; our lodging a tent; and our bed the skin of a
wild beast. Such are the best accommodations we can expect upon our
journey. Are you still ready to undertake it? Does the prospect
not deter you?</p>

<p>No&mdash;I hear you exclaim&mdash;I shall be satisfied with the table&mdash;what
care I for mahogany? With the lodging&mdash;I can tent like an Arab.
With the bed&mdash;fling feathers to the wind!</p>

<p>Enough, brave boy! you shall go with me to the wild regions of
the &ldquo;North-west,&rdquo; to the far &ldquo;fur countries&rdquo; of America. But, first&mdash;a
word about the land through which we are going to travel.</p>

<p>Take down your atlas. Bend your eye upon the map of North
America. Note two large islands&mdash;one upon the right side, Newfoundland;
another upon the left, Vancouver. Draw a line from one
to the other; it will nearly bisect the continent. North of that line
you behold a vast territory. How vast? You may take your scissors,
and clip fifty Englands out of it! There are lakes there in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
you might <i>drown</i> England, or make an island of it! Now, you may
form some idea of the vastness of that region known as the &ldquo;fur
countries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will you believe me, when I tell you that all this immense tract is
a wilderness&mdash;a howling wilderness, if you like a poetical name? It
is even so. From north to south, from ocean to ocean&mdash;throughout
all that vast domain, there is neither town nor village&mdash;hardly anything
that can be dignified with the name of &ldquo;settlement.&rdquo; The only
signs of civilisation to be seen are the &ldquo;forts,&rdquo; or trading posts of the
Hudson's Bay Company; and these &ldquo;signs&rdquo; are few and far&mdash;hundreds
of miles&mdash;between.</p>

<p>For inhabitants, the country has less than ten thousand white men,
the <i>employ&eacute;s</i> of the Company; and its native people are Indians of
many tribes, living far apart, few in numbers, subsisting by the chase,
and half starving for at least a third part of every year! In truth,
the territory can hardly be called &ldquo;inhabited.&rdquo; There is not a man
to every ten miles; and in many parts of it you may travel hundreds
of miles without seeing a face, red, white, or black!</p>

<p>The physical aspect is, therefore, entirely wild. It is very different
in different parts of the territory. One tract is peculiar. It has been
long known as the &ldquo;Barren Grounds.&rdquo; It is a tract of vast extent.
It lies north-west from the shores of Hudson's Bay, extending nearly
to the Mackenzie River. Its rocks are <i>primitive</i>. It is a land of hills
and valleys&mdash;of deep dark lakes and sharp-running streams. It is a
woodless region. No timber is found there that deserves the name.
No trees but glandular dwarf birches, willows, and black spruce, small
and stunted. Even these only grow in isolated valleys. More generally
the surface is covered with coarse sand&mdash;the <i>debris</i> of granite or
quartz-rock&mdash;upon which no vegetable, save the lichen or the moss,
can find life and nourishment.</p>

<p>In one respect these &ldquo;Barren Grounds&rdquo; are unlike the deserts of
Africa: they are well watered. In almost every valley there is a
lake; and though many of these are land-locked, yet do they contain
fish of several species. Sometimes these lakes communicate with each
other by means of rapid and turbulent streams passing through
narrow gorges; and lines of those connected lakes form the great
rivers of the district.</p>

<p>Such is a large portion of the Hudson's Bay territory. Most of the
extensive peninsula of Labrador partakes of a similar character; and
there are other like tracts west of the Rocky Mountain range in the
&ldquo;Russian possessions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet these &ldquo;Barren Grounds&rdquo; have their denizens. Nature has
formed animals that delight to dwell there, and that are never found
in more fertile regions. Two ruminating creatures find sustenance
upon the mosses and lichens that cover their cold rocks: they are the
caribou (reindeer) and the musk-ox. These, in their turn, become the
food and subsistence of preying creatures. The wolf, in all its
varieties of grey, black, white, pied, and dusky, follows upon their
trail. The &ldquo;brown bear&rdquo;&mdash;a large species, nearly resembling the
&ldquo;grizzly&rdquo;&mdash;is found only in the Barren Grounds; and the great
&ldquo;Polar bear&rdquo; comes within their borders, but the latter is a dweller
upon their shores alone, and finds his food among the finny tribes of
the seas that surround them. In marshy ponds, existing here and
there, the musk-rat builds his house, like that of his larger cousin, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
beaver. Upon the water sedge he finds subsistence; but his natural
enemy, the wolverene, skulks in the same neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Polar hare&rdquo; lives upon the leaves and twigs of the dwarf
birch-tree; and this, transformed into its own white flesh, becomes
the food of the Arctic fox. The herbage, sparse though it be, does
not grow in vain. The seeds fall to the earth, but they are not
suffered to decay. They are gathered by the little lemmings and
meadow-mice, who, in their turn, become the prey of two species of
<i>mustelid&aelig;</i>, the ermine and vison weasels. Have the fish of the lakes
no enemy? Yes&mdash;a terrible one in the Canada otter. The mink-weasel,
too, pursues them; and in summer, the osprey, the great
pelican, the cormorant, and the white-headed eagle.</p>

<p>These are the <i>fauna</i> of the Barren Grounds. Man rarely ventures
within their boundaries. The wretched creatures who find a living
there are the Esquimaux on their coasts, and a few Chippewa Indians
in the interior, who hunt the caribou, and are known as &ldquo;caribou-eaters.&rdquo;
Other Indians enter them only in summer, in search of
game, or journeying from point to point; and so perilous are these
journeyings, that numbers frequently perish by the way. There are
no white men in the Barren Grounds. The &ldquo;Company&rdquo; has no
commerce there. No fort is established in them: so scarce are the
fur-bearing animals of these parts, their skins would not repay the
expense of a &ldquo;trading post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Far different are the &ldquo;wooded tracts&rdquo; of the fur countries. These
lie mostly in the southern and central regions of the Hudson's Bay
territory. There are found the valuable beaver and the wolverene
that preys upon it. There dwells the American hare with its enemy
the Canada lynx. There are the squirrels, and the beautiful martens
(sables) that hunt them from tree to tree. There are found the foxes
of every variety, the red, the cross, and the rare and highly-prized
silver-fox, whose shining skin sells for its weight in gold! There, too,
the black bear yields its fine coat to adorn the winter carriage, the
holsters of the dragoon, and the shako of the grenadier. There the
fur-bearing animals exist in greatest plenty, and many others whose
skins are valuable in commerce, as the moose, the wapiti, and the
wood-bison.</p>

<p>But there is also a &ldquo;prairie&rdquo; district in the fur countries. The great
table prairies of North America, that slope eastward from the Rocky
Mountains, also extend northward into the Hudson's Bay territory.
They gradually grow narrower, however, as you proceed farther north,
until, on reaching the latitude of the Great Slave Lake, they end altogether.
This &ldquo;prairie-land&rdquo; has its peculiar animals. Upon it roams
the buffalo, the prong-horned antelope, and the mule-deer. There,
too, may be seen the &ldquo;barking wolf&rdquo; and the &ldquo;swift fox.&rdquo; It is the
favourite home of the marmots, and the gauffres or sand-rats; and
there, too, the noblest of animals, the horse, runs wild.</p>

<p>West of this prairie tract is a region of far different aspect&mdash;the
region of the Rocky Mountains. This stupendous chain, sometimes
called the Andes of North America, continues throughout the fur
countries from their southern limits to the shores of the Arctic Sea.
Some of its peaks overlook the waters of that sea itself, towering up
near the coast. Many of these, even in southern latitudes, carry the
&ldquo;eternal snow.&rdquo; This &ldquo;mountain-chain&rdquo; is, in places, of great
breadth. Deep valleys lie in its embrace, many of which have never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
been visited by man. Some are desolate and dreary; others are
o&auml;ses of vegetation, which fascinate the traveller whose fortune it has
been, after toiling among naked rocks, to gaze upon their smiling
fertility.</p>

<p>These lovely wilds are the favourite home of many strange animals.
The argali, or mountain-sheep, with his huge curving horns, is seen
there; and the shaggy wild goat bounds along the steepest cliffs.
The black bear wanders through the wooded ravines; and his fiercer
congener, the &ldquo;grizzly&rdquo;&mdash;the most dreaded of all American animals&mdash;drags
his huge body along the rocky declivities.</p>

<p>Having crossed the mountains, the fur countries extend westward
to the Pacific. There you encounter barren plains, treeless and
waterless; rapid rivers, that foam through deep, rock-bound
channels; and a country altogether rougher in aspect, and more
mountainous, than that lying to the east of the great chain. A
warmer atmosphere prevails as you approach the Pacific, and in some
places forests of tall trees cover the earth. In these are found most
of the fur-bearing animals; and, on account of the greater warmth
of the climate, the true <i>felid&aelig;</i>&mdash;the long-tailed cats&mdash;here wander
much farther north than upon the eastern side of the continent.
Even so far north as the forests of Oregon these appear in the forms
of the cougar and the ounce.</p>

<p>But it is not our intention at present to cross the Rocky Mountains.
Our journey will lie altogether on the eastern side of that
great chain. It will extend from the frontiers of civilization to the
shores of the Arctic Sea. It is a long and perilous journey, boy
reader; but as we have made up our minds to it, let us waste no
more time in talking, but set forth at once. You are ready? Hurrah!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class="cap">THE YOUNG VOYAGEURS</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>here is a canoe upon the waters of Red River&mdash;Red River of the
north. It is near the source of the stream, but passing downward.
It is a small canoe, a frail structure of birch-bark, and contains only
four persons. They are all young&mdash;the eldest of them evidently not
over nineteen years of age, and the youngest about fifteen.</p>

<p>The eldest is nearly full-grown, though his body and limbs have
not yet assumed the muscular development of manhood. His complexion
is dark, nearly olive. His hair is jet black, straight as an
Indian's, and long. His eyes are large and brilliant, and his features
prominent. His countenance expresses courage, and his well-set jaws
betoken firmness and resolution. He does not belie his looks, for he
possesses these qualifications in a high degree. There is a gravity in
his manner, somewhat rare in one so young; yet it is not the result
of a morose disposition, but a subdued temperament produced by
modesty, good sense, and much experience. Neither has it the air of
stupidity. No: you could easily tell that the mind of this youth, if
once roused, would exhibit both energy and alertness. His quiet
manner has a far different expression. It is an air of coolness and
confidence, which tells you he has met with dangers in the past, and
would not fear to encounter them again.</p>

<p>It is an expression peculiar, I think, to the hunters of the &ldquo;Far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
West,&rdquo;&mdash;those men who dwell amidst dangers in the wild regions of
the great prairies. Their solitary mode of life begets this expression.
They are often for months without the company of a creature with
whom they may converse&mdash;months without beholding a human face.
They live alone with Nature, surrounded by her majestic forms.
These awe them into habits of silence. Such was in point of fact the
case with the youth whom we have been describing. He had hunted
much, though not as a professional hunter. With him the chase had
been followed merely as a pastime; but its pursuit had brought him
into situations of peril, and in contact with Nature in her wild
solitudes. Young as he was, he had journeyed over the grand
prairies, and through the pathless forests of the West. He had slain
the bear and the buffalo, the wild cat and the cougar. These experiences
had made their impression upon his mind, and stamped his
countenance with that air of gravity we have noticed.</p>

<p>The second of the youths whom we shall describe is very different
in appearance. He is of blonde complexion, rather pale, with fair
silken hair that waves gently down his cheeks, and falls upon his
shoulders. He is far from robust. On the contrary, his form is thin
and delicate. It is not the delicacy of feebleness or ill-health, but
only a body of slighter build. The manner in which he handles his
oar shows that he possesses both health and strength, though neither
in such a high degree as the dark youth. His face expresses, perhaps,
a larger amount of intellect, and it is a countenance that would
strike you as more open and communicative. The eye is blue and
mild, and the brow is marked by the paleness of study and habits of
continued thought. These indications are no more than just, for the
fair-haired youth <i>is</i> a student, and one of no ordinary attainments.
Although only seventeen years of age, he is already well versed in the
natural sciences; and many a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge
would but ill compare with him. The former might excel in the
knowledge&mdash;if we can dignify it by that name&mdash;of the laws of
scansion, or in the composition of Greek idylls; but in all that constitutes
<i>real</i> knowledge he would prove but an idle theorist, a dreamy
imbecile, alongside our practical young scholar of the West.</p>

<p>The third and youngest of the party&mdash;taking them as they sit from
stem to bow&mdash;differs in many respects from both those described.
He has neither the gravity of the first, nor yet the intellectuality of
the second. His face is round, and full, and ruddy. It is bright and
smiling in its expression. His eye dances merrily in his head, and
its glance falls upon everything. His lips are hardly ever at rest.
They are either engaged in making words&mdash;for he talks almost incessantly&mdash;or
else contracting and expanding with smiles and joyous
laughter. His cap is jauntily set, and his fine brown curls, hanging
against the rich roseate skin of his cheeks, give to his countenance
an expression of extreme health and boyish beauty. His merry laugh
and free air tell you he is not the boy for books. He is not much of
a hunter either. In fact, he is not particularly given to anything&mdash;one
of those easy natures who take the world as it comes, look upon
the bright side of everything, without getting sufficiently interested
to excel in anything.</p>

<p>These three youths were dressed nearly alike. The eldest wore
the costume, as near as may be, of a backwoods hunter&mdash;a tunic-like
hunting-shirt, of dressed buckskin, leggings and mocassins of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
same material, and all&mdash;shirt, leggings, and mocassins&mdash;handsomely
braided and embroidered with stained quills of the porcupine. The
cape of the shirt was tastefully fringed, and so was the skirt as well
as the seams of the mocassins. On his head was a hairy cap of
raccoon skin, and the tail of the animal, with its dark transverse bars,
hung down behind like the drooping plume of a helmet. Around his
shoulders were two leathern belts that crossed each other upon his
breast. One of these slung a bullet-pouch covered with a violet-green
skin that glittered splendidly in the sun. It was from the
head of the &ldquo;wood-duck&rdquo; the most beautiful bird of its tribe. By
the other strap was suspended a large crescent-shaped horn taken
from the head of an Opelousas bull, and carved with various ornamental
devices. Other smaller implements hung from the belts,
attached by leathern thongs: there was a picker, a wiper, and a steel
for striking fire with. A third belt&mdash;a broad stout one of alligator
leather&mdash;encircled the youth's waist. To this was fastened a holster,
and the shining butt of a pistol could be seen protruding out; a
hunting-knife of the kind denominated &ldquo;bowie&rdquo; hanging over the
left hip, completed his &ldquo;arms and accoutrements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second of the youths was dressed, as already stated, in a somewhat
similar manner, though his accoutrements were not of so warlike
a character. Like the other, he had a powder-horn and pouch,
but instead of knife and pistol, a canvass bag or haversack hung from
his shoulder; and had you looked into it, you would have seen that
it was half filled with shells, pieces of rock, and rare plants, gathered
during the day&mdash;the diurnal storehouse of the geologist, the pal&aelig;ontologist,
and botanist&mdash;to be emptied for study and examination by
the night camp-fire. Instead of the 'coon-skin cap he wore a white
felt hat with broad leaf; and for leggings and mocassins he had
trousers of blue cottonade and laced buskins of tanned leather.</p>

<p>The youngest of the three was dressed and accoutred much like the
eldest, except that his cap was of blue cloth&mdash;somewhat after the
fashion of the military forage cap. All three wore shirts of coloured
cotton, the best for journeying in these uninhabited regions, where
soap is scarce, and a laundress not to be had at any price.</p>

<p>Though very unlike one another, these three youths were brothers.
I knew them well. I had seen them before&mdash;about two years before&mdash;and
though each had grown several inches taller since that time,
I had no difficulty in recognising them. Even though they were
now two thousand miles from where I had formerly encountered
them, I could not be mistaken as to their identity. Beyond a doubt
they were the same brave young adventurers whom I had met in the
swamps of Louisiana, and whose exploits I had witnessed upon the
prairies of Texas. They were the &ldquo;Boy Hunters,&rdquo;&mdash;Basil, Lucien,
Fran&ccedil;ois! I was right glad to renew acquaintance with them. Boy
reader, do you share my joy?</p>

<p>But whither go they now? They are full two thousand miles from
their home in Louisiana. The Red River upon which their canoe
floats is not that Red River, whose blood-like waters sweep through
the swamps of the hot South&mdash;the home of the alligator and the gar.
No, it is a stream of a far different character, though also one of
great magnitude. Upon the banks of the former ripens the rice-plant,
and the sugar-cane waves its golden tassels high in the air.
There, too, flourishes the giant reed, the fan-palm, and the broad-leafed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
magnolia, with its huge snow-white flowers. There the aspect
is Southern, and the heat tropical for most part of the year.</p>

<p>All this is reversed on the Red River of the North. It is true that
on its banks sugar is also produced; but it is no longer from a plant
but a lordly tree&mdash;the great sugar-maple. There is rice too,&mdash;vast
fields of rice upon its marshy borders; but it is not the pearly grain of
the South. It is the wild rice, &ldquo;the water oats,&rdquo; the food of millions of
winged creatures, and thousands of human beings as well. Here, for
three-fourths of the year, the sun is feeble, and the aspect that of
winter. For months the cold waters are bound up in an icy embrace.
The earth is covered with thick snow, over which rise the needle-leafed
<i>conifer&aelig;</i>&mdash;the pines, the cedars, the spruce, and the hemlock.
Very unlike each other are the countries watered by the two streams,
the Red River of the South and its namesake of the North.</p>

<p>But whither go our Boy Hunters in their birch-bark canoe? The
river upon which they are <i>voyaging</i> runs due northward into the
great lake Winnipeg. They are floating with its current, and consequently
increasing the distance from their home. Whither go they?</p>

<p>The answer leads us to some sad reflections. Our joy on again
beholding them is to be mingled with grief. When we last saw them
they had a father, but no mother. Now they have neither one nor
the other. The old Colonel, their father&mdash;the French <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i>, the
<i>hunter naturalist</i>&mdash;is dead. He who had taught them all he knew;
who had taught them to ride, to swim, to dive deep rivers, to fling
the lasso, to climb tall trees, and scale steep cliffs, to bring down
birds upon the wing or beasts upon the run, with the arrow and
the unerring rifle; who had trained them to sleep in the open air, in
the dark forest, on the unsheltered prairie, along the white snow-wreath&mdash;anywhere&mdash;with
but a blanket or a buffalo robe for their
bed; who had taught them to live on the simplest food, and had
imparted to one of them a knowledge of science, of botany in particular,
that enabled them, in case of need, to draw sustenance, from
plants and trees, from roots and fruits, to find resources where
ignorant men would starve.</p>

<p>He also had taught them to kindle a fire without flint, steel, or
detonating powder; to discover their direction without a compass,
from the rocks and the trees and the signs of the heavens; and in
addition to all, had taught them, as far as was then known, the
geography of that vast wilderness that stretches from the Mississippi
to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, and northward to the icy borders
of the Arctic Sea&mdash;he who had taught them all this, their father, was
no more; and his three sons, the &ldquo;boy men,&rdquo; of whom he was so
proud, and of whose accomplishments he was wont to boast, were
now orphans upon the wide world.</p>

<p>But little more than a year after their return from their grand
expedition to the Texan prairies, the &ldquo;old Colonel&rdquo; had died. It
was one of the worst years of that scourge of the South&mdash;the yellow
fever&mdash;and to this dread pestilence he had fallen a victim.</p>

<p>Hugot, the <i>ex-chasseur</i> and attached domestic, who was accustomed
to follow his master like a shadow, had also followed him into the
next world. It was not grief that killed Hugot, though he bore the
loss of his kind master sadly enough. But it was not grief that
killed Hugot. He was laid low by the same disease of which his
master had died&mdash;the yellow fever. A week had scarcely passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
after the death of the latter, before Hugot caught the disease, and
in a few days he was carried to the tomb and laid by the side of his
&ldquo;old Colonel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Boy Hunters&mdash;Basil, Lucien, Fran&ccedil;ois&mdash;became orphans. They
knew of but one relation in the whole world, with whom their father
had kept up any correspondence. This relation was an uncle, and,
strange as it may seem, a Scotchman&mdash;a Highlander, who had
strayed to Corsica in early life, and had there married the Colonel's
sister. That uncle had afterwards emigrated to Canada, and had
become extensively engaged in the fur trade. He was now a superintendent
or &ldquo;factor&rdquo; of the Hudson's Bay Company, stationed at
one of their most remote posts near the shores of the Arctic Sea!
There is a romance in the history of some men wilder than any fiction
that could be imagined.</p>

<p>I have not yet answered the question as to where our Boy Hunters
were journeying in their birch-bark canoe. By this time you will
have divined the answer. Certainly, you will say, they were on
their way to join their uncle in his remote home. For no other
object could they be travelling through the wild regions of the Red
River. That supposition is correct. To visit this Scotch uncle (they
had not seen him for years) was the object of their long, toilsome,
and perilous journey. After their father's death he had sent for
them. He had heard of their exploits upon the prairies; and, being
himself of an adventurous disposition, he was filled with admiration
for his young kinsmen, and desired very much to have them come
and live with him.</p>

<p>Being now their guardian, he might command as much, but it
needed not any exercise of authority on his part to induce all three
of them to obey his summons. They had travelled through the
mighty forests of the Mississippi, and upon the summer prairies of
the South. These great features of the earth's surface were to them
familiar things, and they were no longer curious about them. But
there remained a vast country which they longed eagerly to explore.
They longed to look upon its shining lakes and crystal rivers; upon
its snow-clad hills and ice-bound streams; upon its huge mammalia&mdash;its
moose and its musk-oxen, its wapiti and its monster bears. This
was the very country to which they were now invited by their kinsman,
and cheerfully did they accept his invitation.</p>

<p>Already had they made one-half the journey, though by far the
easier half. They had travelled up the Mississippi by steamboat as
far as the mouth of the St. Peter's. There they had commenced their
canoe voyage&mdash;in other words became &ldquo;voyageurs&rdquo;&mdash;for such is the
name given to those who travel by canoes through these wild territories.
Their favourite horses and the mule &ldquo;Jeannette&rdquo; had been
left behind. This was a necessity, as these creatures, however useful
upon the dry prairies of the South, where there are few or no lakes,
and where rivers only occur at long intervals, would be of little
service to the traveller in the Northern regions. Here the route is
crossed and intercepted by numerous rivers; and lakes of all sizes,
with tracts of inundated marsh, succeed one another continually.
Such, in fact, are the highways of the country, and the canoe the
travelling carriage; so that a journey from one point of the Hudson's
Bay territory to another is often a canoe voyage of thousands of
miles&mdash;equal to a &ldquo;trip&rdquo; across the Atlantic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>Following the usual custom, therefore, our Boy Hunters had become
voyageurs&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Young Voyageurs</i>.&rdquo; They had navigated the St. Peter's
in safety, almost to its head-waters. These interlock with the
sources of the Red River. By a &ldquo;portage&rdquo; of a few miles they had
crossed to the latter stream; and, having launched their canoe upon
its waters, were now floating downward and northward with its
current. But they had yet a long journey before them&mdash;nearly two
thousand miles! Many a river to be &ldquo;run,&rdquo; many a rapid to be
&ldquo;shot,&rdquo; many a lake to be crossed, and many a &ldquo;portage&rdquo; to be
passed, ere they could reach the end of that great <i>voyage</i>.</p>

<p>Come, boy reader, shall we accompany them? Yes. The strange
scenes and wild adventures through which we must pass, may
lighten the toils, and perhaps repay us for the perils of the journey.
Think not of the toils. Roses grow only upon thorns. From toil we
learn to enjoy leisure. Regard not the perils. &ldquo;From the nettle
danger we pluck the flower safety.&rdquo; Security often springs from
peril. From such hard experiences great men have arisen. Come,
then, my young friend! mind neither toil nor peril, but with me to
the great wilderness of the North!</p>

<p>Stay! We are to have another &ldquo;<i>compagnon du voyage</i>.&rdquo; There is a
fourth in the boat, a fourth &ldquo;young voyageur.&rdquo; Who is he? In
appearance he is as old as Basil, full as tall, and not unlike him in
&ldquo;build.&rdquo; But he is altogether of a different <i>colour</i>. He is fair-haired;
but his hair (unlike that of Lucien, which is also light-coloured) is
strong, crisp, and curly. It does not droop, but stands out over his
cheeks in a profusion of handsome ringlets. His complexion is of
that kind known as &ldquo;fresh,&rdquo; and the weather, to which it has
evidently been much exposed, has bronzed and rather enriched the
colour. The eyes are dark blue, and, strange to say, with <i>black</i>
brows and lashes! This is not common, though sometimes observed;
and, in the case of the youth we are describing, arose from a difference
of complexion on the part of his parents. He looked through
the eyes of his mother, while in other respects he was more like his
father, who was fair-haired and of a &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; colour.</p>

<p>The youth, himself, might be termed handsome. Perhaps he did
not possess the youthful beauty of Fran&ccedil;ois, nor the bolder kind that
characterized the face of Basil. Perhaps he was of a coarser &ldquo;make&rdquo;
than any of his three companions. His intellect had been less cultivated
by education, and <i>education adds to the beauty of the face</i>. His life
had been a harder one&mdash;he had toiled more with his hands, and had
seen less of civilized society. Still many would have pronounced him
a handsome youth. His features were regular, and of clean outline.
His lips expressed good-nature as well as firmness. His eye beamed
with native intelligence, and his whole face bespoke a heart of true
and determined honesty&mdash;<i>that made it beautiful</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a close scrutinizer of countenances might have detected
some resemblance&mdash;a family one&mdash;between him and his three companions.
If such there was, it was very slight; but there might have
been, from the relationship that existed between them and him. He
was their cousin&mdash;their full cousin&mdash;the only son of that uncle they
were now on their way to visit, and the messenger who had been sent
to bring them. Such was the fourth of &ldquo;the young voyageurs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His dress was not unlike that worn by Basil; but as he was seated
on the bow, and acting as pilot, and therefore more likely to feel the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
cold, he wore over his hunting-shirt, a Canadian <i>capote</i> of white
woollen cloth, with its hood hanging down upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>But there was still another &ldquo;voyageur,&rdquo; an old acquaintance, whom
you, boy reader, will no doubt remember. This was an animal, a
quadruped, who lay along the bottom of the canoe upon a buffalo's
hide. &ldquo;From his size and colour&mdash;which was a tawny red&mdash;you might
have mistaken him for a panther&mdash;a cougar. His long black muzzle
and broad hanging ears gave him quite a different aspect, however,
and declared him to be a hound. He <i>was</i> one&mdash;a bloodhound, with
the cross of a mastiff&mdash;a powerful animal. It was the dog 'Marengo.'&rdquo;
You remember Marengo?</p>

<p>In the canoe there were other objects of interest. There were
blankets and buffalo robes; there was a small canvas tent folded up;
there were bags of provisions, and some cooking utensils; there was
a spade and an axe; there were rifles&mdash;three of them&mdash;and a double-barrelled
shot-gun; besides a fish-net, and many other articles, the
necessary equipments for such a journey.</p>

<p>Loaded almost to the gunwale was that little canoe, yet lightly did
it float down the waters of the Red River of the North.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class="cap">THE TRUMPETER SWAN AND THE BALD EAGLE</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span>t was the spring season, though late. The snow had entirely disappeared
from the hills, and the ice from the water, and the melting
of both had swollen the river, and rendered its current more rapid
than usual. Our young voyageurs needed not therefore to ply their
oars, except now and then to guide the canoe; for these little vessels
have no rudder, but are steered by the paddles. The skilful voyageurs
can shoot them to any point they please, simply by their dexterous
handling of the oars; and Basil, Lucien, and Fran&ccedil;ois, had had
sufficient practice both with &ldquo;skiffs&rdquo; and &ldquo;dug-outs&rdquo; to make good
oarsmen of all three. They had made many a canoe trip upon the
lower Mississippi and the bayous of Louisiana; besides their journey
up the St. Peter's had rendered them familiar with the management
of their birchen craft. An occasional stroke of the paddle kept them
in their course, and they floated on without effort.</p>

<p>Norman&mdash;such was the name of their Canadian or Highland cousin&mdash;sat
in the bow and directed their course. This is the post of honour
in a canoe; and as he had more experience than any of them in this
sort of navigation, he was allowed habitually to occupy this post.
Lucien sat in the stern. He held in his hands a book and pencil;
and as the canoe glided onward, he was noting down his memoranda.
The trees upon the banks were in leaf&mdash;many of them in blossom&mdash;and
as the little craft verged near the shore, his keen eye followed
the configuration of the leaves, to discover any new species that might
appear.</p>

<p>There is a rich vegetation upon the banks of the Red River; but
the <i>flora</i> is far different from that which appears upon the low <i>alluvion</i>
of Louisiana. It is Northern, but not Arctic. Oaks, elms, and
poplars, are seen mingling with birches, willows, and aspens. Several
species of indigenous fruit trees were observed by Lucien, among
which were crab-apple, raspberry, strawberry, and currant. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
was also seen the fruit called by the voyageurs &ldquo;le poire,&rdquo; but which
in English phraseology is known as the &ldquo;service-berry.&rdquo; It grows
upon a small bush or shrub of six or eight feet high, with smooth
pinnate leaves. These pretty red berries are much esteemed and
eaten both by Indians and whites, who preserve them by drying,
and cook them in various ways.</p>

<p>There was still another bush that fixed the attention of our young
botanist, as it appeared all along the banks, and was a <i>characteristic</i>
of the vegetation of the country. It was not over eight feet in
height, with spreading branches of a grey-colour. Its leaves were
three inches wide, and somewhat lobed like those of the oak. Of
course, at this early season, the fruit was not ripe upon it; but Lucien
knew the fruit well. When ripe it resembles very much a red cherry,
or, still more, a cranberry, having both the appearance and acrid
taste of the latter. Indeed, it is sometimes used as a substitute for
cranberries in the making of pies and tarts; and in many parts it is
called the &ldquo;bush cranberry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name, however, by which it is known among the Indians of
Red River is &ldquo;<i>anepeminan</i>&rdquo; from &ldquo;<i>nepen</i>,&rdquo; summer, and &ldquo;<i>minan</i>,&rdquo;
berry. This has been corrupted by the fur-traders and voyageurs
into &ldquo;Pembina;&rdquo; hence, the name of a river which runs into the Red,
and also the name of the celebrated but unsuccessful settlement of
&ldquo;Pembina,&rdquo; formed by Lord Selkirk many years ago. Both took
their names from this berry that grows in abundance in the neighbourhood.
The botanical appellation of this curious shrub is
<i>Viburnum oxycoccos</i>; but there is another species of the viburnum,
which is also styled &ldquo;oxycoccos.&rdquo; The common &ldquo;snowball bush&rdquo; of
our garden is a plant of the same genus, and very like the &ldquo;Pembina,&rdquo;
both in leaf and flower. In fact, in a wild state they might be
regarded as the same; but it is well known that the flowers of the
snowball are sterile, and do not produce the beautiful bright crimson
berries of the &ldquo;Pembina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucien lectured upon these points to his companions as they floated
along. Norman listened with astonishment to his philosophic cousin,
who, although he had never been in this region before, knew more of
its plants and trees than he did himself. Basil also was interested in
the explanations given by his brother. On the contrary, Fran&ccedil;ois,
who cared but little for botanical studies, or studies of any sort, was
occupied differently. He sat near the middle of the canoe, double-barrel
in hand, eagerly watching for a shot. Many species of water-fowl
were upon the river, for it was now late in the spring, and the
wild geese and ducks had all arrived, and were passing northward
upon their annual migration. During the day Fran&ccedil;ois had got
several shots, and had &ldquo;bagged&rdquo; three wild geese, all of different
kinds, for there are many species of wild geese in America.</p>

<p>He had also shot some ducks. But this did not satisfy him. There
was a bird upon the river that could not be approached. No matter
how the canoe was man&#339;uvred, this shy creature always took flight
before Fran&ccedil;ois could get within range. For days he had been
endeavouring to kill one. Even upon the St. Peter's many of them
had been seen, sometimes in pairs, at other times in small flocks of
six or seven, but always shy and wary. The very difficulty of getting
a shot at them, along with the splendid character of the birds themselves,
had rendered Fran&ccedil;ois eager to obtain one. The bird itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
was no other than the great wild swan&mdash;the king of aquatic
birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, brother!&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois, addressing Lucien, &ldquo;bother your
viburnums and your oxycocks! Tell us something about these swans.
See! there goes another of them! What a splendid fellow he is!
I'd give something to have him within range of buckshot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Fran&ccedil;ois spoke he pointed down-stream to a great white bird
that was seen moving out from the bank. It was a swan, and one of
the very largest kind&mdash;&ldquo;a trumpeter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had been feeding in a sedge of the wild rice, and no doubt the
sight of the canoe or the plash of the guiding oar had disturbed, and
given it the alarm. It shot out from the reeds with head erect and
wings slightly raised, offering to the eyes of the voyageurs a spectacle
of graceful and majestic bearing, that, among the feathered race at
least, is quite inimitable.</p>

<p>A few strokes of its broad feet propelled it into the open water
near the middle of the stream, when, making a half wheel, it turned
head down the river, and swam with the current.</p>

<p>At the point where it turned it was not two hundred yards ahead
of the canoe. Its apparent boldness in permitting them to come so
near without taking wing, led Fran&ccedil;ois to hope that they might get
still nearer; and, begging his companions to ply the paddles, he
seized hold of his double-barrel, and leaned forward in the canoe.
Basil also conceived a hope that a shot was to be had, for he took up
his rifle, and looked to the cock and cap. The others went steadily
and quietly to work at the oars. In a few moments the canoe cleft
the current at the rate of a galloping horse, and one would have
supposed that the swan must either at once take wing or be overtaken.</p>

<p>Not so, however. The &ldquo;trumpeter&rdquo; knew his game better than
that. He had full confidence both in his strength and speed upon
the water. He was not going to undergo the trouble of a fly, until
the necessity arose for so doing; and, as it was, he seemed to be
satisfied that that necessity had not yet arrived. The swim cost
him much less muscular exertion than flying would have done, and
he judged that the current, here very swift, would carry him out of
reach of his pursuers.</p>

<p>It soon began to appear that he judged rightly; and the voyageurs,
to their chagrin, saw that, instead of gaining upon him, as they had
expected, every moment widened the distance between him and the
canoe. The bird had an advantage over his pursuers. Three distinct
powers propelled him, while they had only two to rely upon. He
had the current in his favour&mdash;so had they. He had oars or paddles&mdash;his
feet; they had oars as well. He &ldquo;carried sail,&rdquo; while they
spread not a &ldquo;rag.&rdquo; The wind chanced to blow directly down-stream,
and the broad wings of the bird, held out from his body, and
half extended, caught the very pith of the breeze on their double
concave surfaces, and carried him through the water with the velocity
of an arrow. Do you think that he was not aware of this advantage
when he started in the race?</p>

<p>Do you suppose that these birds do not <i>think</i>? I for one am
satisfied they do, and look upon every one who prates about the
<i>instinct</i> of these creatures as a philosopher of a very old school indeed.
Not only does the great swan think, but so does your parrot, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
your piping bullfinch, and the little canary that hops on your thumb.
All think, and <i>reason</i>, and <i>judge</i>. Should it ever be your fortune to
witness the performance of those marvellous birds, exhibited by the
graceful Mdlle. Vandermeersch in the fashionable <i>salons</i> of Paris and
London, you will agree with me in the belief that the smallest of
them has a mind like yourself.</p>

<p>Most certainly the swan, which our voyageurs were pursuing,
thought, and reasoned, and judged, and calculated his distance, and
resolved to keep on &ldquo;the even tenor of his way,&rdquo; without putting
himself to extra trouble by beating the air with his wings, and
lifting his heavy body&mdash;thirty pounds at least&mdash;up into the heavens.
His judgment proved sound; for, in less than ten minutes from the
commencement of the chase, he had gained a clear hundred yards
upon his pursuers, and continued to widen the distance. At intervals
he raised his beak higher than usual, and uttered his loud booming
note, which fell upon the ears of the voyageurs as though it had been
sent back in mockery and defiance.</p>

<p>They would have given up the pursuit, had they not noticed that
a few hundred yards farther down the river made a sharp turn to
the right. The swan, on reaching this, would no longer have the
wind in his favour. This inspired them with fresh hopes. They
thought they would be able to overtake him after passing the bend,
and then, either get a shot at him, or force him into the air. The
latter was the more likely; and, although it would be no great
gratification to see him fly off, yet they had become so interested
in this singular chase that they desired to terminate it by putting
the trumpeter to some trouble. They bent, therefore, with fresh
energy to their oars, and pulled onward in the pursuit.</p>

<p>First the swan, and after him the canoe, swung round the bend,
and entered the new &ldquo;reach&rdquo; of the river. The voyageurs at once
perceived that the bird now swam more slowly. He no longer
&ldquo;carried sail,&rdquo; as the wind was no longer in his favour. His wings
lay closely folded to his body, and he moved only by the aid of his
webbed feet and the current, which last happened to be sluggish,
as the river at this part spread over a wide expanse of level land.
The canoe was evidently catching up, and each stroke was bringing
the pursuers nearer to the pursued.</p>

<p>After a few minutes' brisk pulling, the trumpeter had lost so
much ground that he was not two hundred yards in the advance,
and &ldquo;dead ahead.&rdquo; His body was no longer carried with the same
gracefulness, and the majestic curving of his neck had disappeared.
His bill protruded forward, and his thighs began to drag the water
in his wake. He was evidently on the threshold of flight. Both
Fran&ccedil;ois and Basil saw this, as they stood with their guns crossed
and ready.</p>

<p>At this moment a shrill cry sounded over the water. It was the
scream of some wild creature, ending in a strange laugh, like the
laugh of a maniac!</p>

<p>On both sides of the river there was a thick forest of tall trees
of the cotton-wood species. From this forest the strange cry had
proceeded, and from the right bank. Its echoes had hardly ceased,
when it was answered by a similar cry from the trees upon the left.
So like were the two, that it seemed as if some one of God's wild
creatures was mocking another. These cries were hideous enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
to frighten any one not used to them. They had not that effect
upon our voyageurs, who knew their import. One and all of them
were familiar with the voice of the <i>white-headed eagle</i>!</p>

<p>The trumpeter knew it as well as any of them, but on him it
produced a far different effect. His terror was apparent, and his
intention was all at once changed. Instead of rising into the air, as
he had premeditated, he suddenly lowered his head, and disappeared
under the water!</p>

<p>Again was heard the wild scream and the maniac laugh; and the
next moment an eagle swept out from the timber, and, after a few
strokes of its broad wing, poised itself over the spot where the
trumpeter had gone down. The other, its mate, was seen crossing at
the same time from the opposite side.</p>

<p>Presently the swan rose to the surface, but his head was hardly
out of the water when the eagle once more uttered its wild note,
and, half folding its wings, darted down from above. The swan
seemed to have expected this, for before the eagle could reach the
surface, he had gone under a second time, and the latter, though
passing with the velocity of an arrow, plunged his talons in the
water to no purpose. With a cry of disappointment the eagle
mounted back into the air, and commenced wheeling in circles over
the spot. It was now joined by its mate, and both kept round and
round watching for the reappearance of their intended victim.</p>

<p>Again the swan came to the surface, but before either of the eagles
could swoop upon him he had for the third time disappeared. The
swan is but an indifferent diver; but under such circumstances he
was likely to do his best at it. But what could it avail him? He
must soon rise to the surface to take breath&mdash;each time at shorter
intervals. He would soon become fatigued and unable to dive with
sufficient celerity, and then his cruel enemies would be down upon
him with their terrible talons. Such is the usual result, unless the
swan takes to the air, which he sometimes does. In the present case
he had built his hopes upon a different means of escape. He contemplated
being able to conceal himself in a heavy sedge of bulrushes
that grew along the edge of the river, and towards these he was
evidently directing his course under the water.</p>

<p>At each emersion he appeared some yards nearer them, until at
length he rose within a few feet of their margin, and diving again
was seen no more! He had crept in among the sedge, and no doubt
was lying with only his head, or part of it, above the water, his body
concealed by the broad leaves of the <i>nymph&aelig;</i>, while the head itself
could not be distinguished among the white flowers that lay thickly
along the surface.</p>

<p>The eagles now wheeled over the sedge, flapping the tops of the
bulrushes with their broad wings, and screaming with disappointed
rage. Keen as were their eyes they could not discover the hiding-place
of their victim. No doubt they would have searched for it a
long time, but the canoe&mdash;which they now appeared to notice for the
first time&mdash;had floated near; and, becoming aware of their own
danger, both mounted into the air again, and with a farewell scream
flew off, and alighted at some distance down the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A swan for supper!&rdquo; shouted Fran&ccedil;ois, as he poised his gun for
the expected shot.</p>

<p>The canoe was headed for the bulrushes near the point where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
trumpeter had been last seen; and a few strokes of the paddles
brought the little craft with a whizzing sound among the sedge. But
the culms of the rushes were so tall, and grew so closely together,
that the canoe-men, after entering, found to their chagrin they could
not see six feet around them. They dared not stand up, for this is
exceedingly dangerous in a birch canoe, where the greatest caution is
necessary to keep the vessel from careening over. Moreover, the sedge
was so thick, that it was with difficulty they could use their oars.</p>

<p>They remained stationary for a time, surrounded by a wall of green
bulrush. They soon perceived that that would never do, and resolved
to push back into the open water. Meanwhile Marengo had been
sent into the sedge, and was now heard plunging and sweltering
about in search of the game. Marengo was not much of a water-dog
by nature, but he had been trained to almost every kind of hunting,
and his experience among the swamps of Louisiana had long since
relieved him of all dread for the water. His masters therefore had
no fear but that Marengo would &ldquo;put up&rdquo; the trumpeter.</p>

<p>Marengo had been let loose a little too soon. Before the canoe
could be cleared of the entangling sedge, the dog was heard to utter
one of his loud growls, then followed a heavy plunge, there was a
confused fluttering of wings, and the great white bird rose majestically
into the air! Before either of the gunners could direct their
aim, he was beyond the range of shot, and both prudently reserved
their fire. Marengo having performed his part, swam back to the
canoe, and was lifted over the gunwale.</p>

<p>The swan, after clearing the sedge, rose almost vertically into the
air. These birds usually fly at a great elevation&mdash;sometimes entirely
beyond the reach of sight. Unlike the wild geese and ducks, they
never alight upon land, but always upon the bosom of the water. It
was evidently the intention of this one to go far from the scene of his
late dangers, perhaps to the great lake Winnipeg itself.</p>

<p>After attaining a height of several hundred yards, he flew forward
in a horizontal course, and followed the direction of the stream. His
flight was now regular, and his trumpet note could be heard at intervals,
as, with outstretched neck, he glided along the heavens. He
seemed to feel the pleasant sensations that every creature has after
an escape from danger, and no doubt he fancied himself secure. But
in this fancy he deceived himself. Better for him had he risen a few
hundred yards higher, or else had uttered his self-gradulation in a
more subdued tone; for it was heard and answered, and that response
was the maniac laugh of the white-headed eagle.</p>

<p>At the same instant two of these birds&mdash;those already introduced&mdash;were
seen mounting into the air. They did not fly up vertically, as
the swan had done, but in spiral curves, wheeling and crossing each
other as they ascended. They were making for a point that would
intersect the flight of the swan should he keep on in his horizontal
course. This, however, he did not do. With an eye as quick as theirs,
he saw that he was &ldquo;headed;&rdquo; and, stretching his long neck upward,
he again pursued an almost vertical line.</p>

<p>But he had to carry thirty pounds of flesh and bones, while the
largest of the eagles&mdash;the female bird&mdash;with a still broader spread of
wing, was a &ldquo;light weight&rdquo; of only seven. The result of this difference
was soon apparent. Before the trumpeter had got two hundred yards
higher, the female of the eagles was seen wheeling around him on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
same level. The swan was now observed to double, fly downward,
and then upward again, while his mournful note echoed back to the
earth. But his efforts were in vain. After a series of contortions
and man&#339;uvres, the eagle darted forward, with a quick toss threw
herself back-downward, and, striking upward, planted her talons in
the under part of the wing of her victim. The lacerated shaft fell
uselessly down; and the great white bird, no longer capable of flight,
came whistling through the air.</p>

<span class="caption">THE TRUMPETER SWAN AND THE BALD EAGLE.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>But it was not allowed to drop directly to the earth; it would have
fallen on the bosom of the broad river, and that the eagles did not
wish, as it would have given them some trouble to get the heavy
carcass ashore. As soon as the male&mdash;who was lower in the air&mdash;saw
that his partner had struck the bird, he discontinued his upward
flight, and, poising himself on his spread tail, waited its descent. A
single instant was sufficient. The white object passed him still
fluttering; but the moment it was below his level he shot after it like
an arrow, and, clutching it in his talons, with an outward stroke sent
it whizzing in a diagonal direction. The next moment a crashing
was heard among the twigs, and a dull sound announced that the
swan had fallen upon the earth.</p>

<p>The eagles were now seen sailing downward, and soon disappeared
among the tops of the trees.</p>

<p>The canoe soon reached the bank; and Fran&ccedil;ois, accompanied by
Basil and Marengo, leaped ashore, and went in search of the birds.
They found the swan quite dead and lying upon its back as the eagles
had turned it. Its breast was torn open, and the crimson blood, with
which they had been gorging themselves, was spread in broad flakes
over its snowy plumage. The eagles themselves, scared by the dog
Marengo, had taken flight before the boys could get within shot of
them.</p>

<p>As it was just the hour for a &ldquo;noon halt&rdquo; and a luncheon, the swan
was carried to the bank of the river, where a crackling fire was soon
kindled to roast him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class="cap">A SWAN-HUNT BY TORCHLIGHT</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span> few days brought our travellers to the settlement of Red River,
where they made but a very short stay; and, having procured a few
articles which they stood in need of, they resumed their journey, and
floated on towards Lake Winnipeg. The swans were seen in greater
numbers than ever. They were not less shy however, and Fran&ccedil;ois,
as before, in vain tried to get a shot at one.</p>

<p>He was very desirous of bringing down one of these noble birds,
partly because the taste he had had of their flesh had given him a
liking for it; and partly because their shyness had greatly tantalized
him. One is always more eager to kill shy game, both on account of
the rarity of the thing, and the credit one gets for his expertness.
But the voyageurs had now got within less than twenty miles of
Lake Winnipeg, and Fran&ccedil;ois had not as yet shot a single swan. It
was not at all likely the eagles would help him to another. So there
would be no more roast swan for supper.</p>

<p>Norman, seeing how eager Fran&ccedil;ois was to shoot one of these birds,
resolved to aid him by his advice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin Frank,&rdquo; said he, one evening as they floated along, &ldquo;you
wish very much to get a shot at the swans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Fran&ccedil;ois,&mdash;&ldquo;I do; and if you can tell me how to
accomplish that business, I'll make you a present of this knife.&rdquo;
Here Fran&ccedil;ois held up a very handsome clasp-knife that he carried
in his pouch.</p>

<p>A knife in the fur countries is no insignificant affair. With a knife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
you may sometimes buy a horse, or a tent, or a whole carcass of beef,
or, what is stranger still, a wife! To the hunter in these wild
regions&mdash;perhaps a thousand miles from where knives are sold&mdash;such
a thing is of very great value indeed; but the knife which Fran&ccedil;ois
offered to his cousin was a particularly fine one, and the latter had
once expressed a wish to become the owner of it. He was not slow,
therefore, in accepting the conditions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined he, &ldquo;you must consent to travel a few miles by
night, and I think I can promise you a shot at the trumpeters&mdash;perhaps
several.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What say you, brothers?&rdquo; asked Fran&ccedil;ois, appealing to Basil and
Lucien; &ldquo;shall we have the sport? Say yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I have no objection,&rdquo; said Lucien.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; added Basil. &ldquo;On the contrary, I should like it above
all things. I wish very much to know what plan our cousin shall
adopt. I never heard of any mode of approaching these birds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; answered Norman, &ldquo;I shall have the pleasure of
instructing you in a way that is in use in these parts among the
Indians, who hunt the swan for its skin and quills, which they trade
to us at the post. We can manage it to-night, I think,&rdquo; continued
he, looking up at the sky: &ldquo;there is no moon, and the sky is thick.
Yes, it will be dark enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it necessary the night should be a dark one?&rdquo; asked Fran&ccedil;ois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The darker the better,&rdquo; replied Norman. &ldquo;To-night, if I am not
mistaken, will be as black as pitch. But we need to make some preparations.
It is near sundown, and we shall have just time to get
ready for the business. Let us get ashore, then, as quickly as
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! certainly&mdash;let us land,&rdquo; replied all three at once.</p>

<p>The canoe was now turned to the shore; and when it had arrived
within a few feet of the land it was brought to a stop. Its keel was
not allowed to touch the bottom of the river, as that would have
injured the little craft. The greatest precaution is always observed
both in landing and embarking these vessels. The voyageurs first
get out and wade to the shore, one or two remaining to hold the
canoe in its place. The cargo, whatever it be, is then taken out and
landed; and after that the canoe itself is lifted out of the water, and
carried ashore, where it is set, bottom upward, to dry.</p>

<p>The birch-bark canoe is so frail a structure, that, were it brought
rudely in contact either with the bottom or the bank, it would be
very much damaged, or might go to pieces altogether. Hence the
care with which it is handled. It is dangerous, also, to stand upright
in it, as it is so &ldquo;crank&rdquo; that it would easily turn over, and
spill both canoe-men and cargo into the water. The voyageurs, therefore,
when once they have got in, remain seated during the whole
passage, shifting about as little as they can help. When landed for
the night, the canoe is always taken out of the water as described.
The bark is of a somewhat spongy nature; and if left in the water
for a length of time, would become soaked and heavy, and would not
run so well. When kept all night, bottom upward, it drips and
becomes dryer and lighter. In the morning, at the commencement
of the day's journey, it sits higher upon the water than in the afternoon
and evening, and is at that time more easily paddled along.</p>

<p>Our voyageurs, having got on shore, first kindled a fire to cook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
their supper. This they intended to despatch earlier than usual, so
as to give them the early part of the night for their swan hunt, which
they expected to finish before midnight. Lucien did the cooking,
while Norman, assisted by Basil and Fran&ccedil;ois, made his preparations
for the hunt. Fran&ccedil;ois, who was more interested in the result than
any of them, watched every movement of his cousin. Nothing
escaped him.</p>

<p>Norman proceeded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>He walked off into the woods, accompanied by Fran&ccedil;ois. After
going about an hundred yards or so, he stopped at the foot of a certain
tree. The tree was a birch&mdash;easily distinguished by its smooth,
silvery bark. By means of his sharp hunting-knife he &ldquo;girdled&rdquo; this
tree near the ground, and then higher up, so that the length between
the two &ldquo;girdlings,&rdquo; or circular cuttings, was about four feet. He
then made a longitudinal incision by drawing the point of his knife
from one circle to the other. This done he inserted the blade under
the bark, and peeled it off, as he would have taken the skin from a
buffalo. The tree was a foot in diameter, consequently the bark,
when stripped off and spread flat, was about three feet in width; for
you must remember that the circumference of a circle or a cylinder
is always about three times the length of its diameter, and therefore
a tree is three times as much &ldquo;<i>round</i>&rdquo; as it is &ldquo;<i>through</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They now returned to the camp-fire, taking along with them the
piece of bark that had been cut off. This was spread out, though not
quite flat, still leaving it somewhat curved. The convex side, that
which had lain towards the tree, was now blackened with pulverized
charcoal, which Norman had directed Basil to prepare for the purpose;
and to the bark at one end was fastened a stake or shaft.
Nothing more remained but to fix this stake in the canoe, in an upright
position near the bow, and in such a way that the bottom of
the piece of bark would be upon a level with the seats, with its
hollow side looking forward. It would thus form a screen, and prevent
those in the canoe from being seen by any creature that might
be ahead.</p>

<p>When all this had been arranged, Norman shouldered the axe,
and again walked off into the woods. This time his object was to
obtain a quantity of &ldquo;knots&rdquo; of the pitch-pine (<i>Pinus rigida</i>), which
he knew would most likely be found in such a situation. The tree
was soon discovered, and pointed out to Fran&ccedil;ois, who accompanied
him as before. Fran&ccedil;ois saw that it was a tree of about fifty feet in
height, and a foot in diameter at its base. Its bark was thick, very
dark in the colour, and full of cracks or fissures. Its leaves, or
&ldquo;needles,&rdquo; were about three inches long, and grew in threes, each
three forming a little bunch, bound together at its base by a
brownish sheath.</p>

<p>These bunches, in botanical language, are termed &ldquo;fasciles.&rdquo;
The cones were somewhat shorter than the leaves, nearly the shape
of eggs, and clustered together in threes and fours. Fran&ccedil;ois noticed
that the tree was thickly branched, and therefore there are many
knots in the wood. For this reason it is not much use as timber; but
on account of the resin which it contains, it is the best species for
firewood; and for that purpose it is used in all parts of the United
States, where it grows. Most of the <i>pine-wood</i> sold for fuel in the
large cities of America is the wood of this species.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois supposed that his companion was about to fell one of the
trees. He was mistaken, however; Norman had no such intention;
he had only stopped before one to examine it, and make sure that it
was the species he was in search of. He was soon satisfied of this, and
moved on, directing his eyes along the ground. Again he stopped;
but this time it was by a tree that had already fallen&mdash;blown down,
perhaps, by the wind. It was half decayed; but Fran&ccedil;ois could see
that it was one of the same species&mdash;the pitch-pine.</p>

<p>This was the very thing Norman wanted, and plying his axe, he
soon knocked out a large quantity of the resinous knots. These he at
length collected, and putting them into a bag, returned with Fran&ccedil;ois
to the fire. He then announced that he had no further preparations
to make.</p>

<p>All four now sat down to supper, which consisted of dry meat, with
biscuits and coffee; and, as their appetites were sharpened by their
water journey, they made a hearty meal of it.</p>

<p>As soon as they had finished eating, the canoe was launched and
got ready. The screen of birch-bark was set up, by lashing its shaft
to the bottom timbers, and also to one of the seats. Immediately in
front of this, and out upon the bow, was placed the frying-pan; and
this having been secured by being tied at the handle, was filled with
dry pine-knots, ready to be kindled at a moment's notice. These
arrangements being made, the hunters only awaited the darkness to
set forth.</p>

<p>In the progress of their hunt they would be carried still farther
down-stream; but as that was the direction in which they were
travelling, they would only be progressing on their journey, and thus
&ldquo;killing two birds with one stone.&rdquo; This was altogether a very
pleasant consideration; and having stowed everything snugly in the
canoe, they sat chatting agreeably and waiting for the arrival of
night.</p>

<p>Night came at length, and, as Norman had predicted, it was as
&ldquo;dark as pitch.&rdquo; Stepping gently into the canoe, and seating themselves
in their respective places, they pushed out and commenced
floating down-stream. Norman sat near the bow, in order to attend
to his torch of pine-knots. Fran&ccedil;ois was next to him, holding his
double-barrel, loaded with buckshot, which is the same size as that
used for swans, and in England is even known as &ldquo;swan-shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next came Basil with his rifle. He sat near Fran&ccedil;ois, just by the
middle of the little vessel. Lucien, who was altogether a man of
peace principles, and but little of a shot compared with either of his
brothers, handled the oar&mdash;not to propel the canoe, but merely to
guide it. In this way the party floated on in silence.</p>

<p>Norman soon kindled his torch, which now cast its red glare over
the surface of the river, extending its fiery radii even to the banks
on both sides of the stream. The trees that overhung the water
seemed tinged with vermilion, and the rippling wave sparkled like
liquid gold. The light only extended over a semicircle. From the
manner in which the torch was placed, its light did not fall upon the
other half of the circle, and this, by contrast, appeared even darker
than it would otherwise have done.</p>

<p>The advantage of the plan which Norman had adopted was at once
apparent to all. Ahead of the canoe the whole river was plainly seen,
for a distance of several hundred yards. No object larger than a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
cork could have floated on its surface, without being visible to those
in the vessel&mdash;much less the great white body of a trumpeter swan.
Astern of the canoe, on the other hand, all was pitchy darkness, and
any one looking at the vessel from a position ahead could have seen
nothing but the bright torch and the black uniform surface behind it.</p>

<p>As I have already stated, the convex side of the bark was <i>towards</i>
the blaze, and the pan containing the torch being placed close into
the screen, none of the light could possibly fall upon the forms of
those within the canoe. They were therefore invisible to any creature
from the front, while they themselves could see everything before
them.</p>

<p>Two questions yet remained unanswered. First&mdash;would our hunters
find any swans on the river? Second&mdash;if they should, would these
birds allow themselves to be approached near enough to be shot at?
The first question Norman, of course, could not answer. That was a
matter beyond his knowledge or control. The swans might or might
not appear, but it was to be hoped they would. It was likely enough.
Many had been seen on the preceding day, and why not then? To
the second question, the young Canadian gave a definite reply.</p>

<p>He assured his cousins that, if met with, the birds would be easily
approached in this manner; he had often hunted them so. They
would either keep their place, and remain until the light came very
near them, or they would move towards it (as he had many times
known them to do), attracted by curiosity and the novelty of the
spectacle. He had hunted deer in the same manner; he had shot, he
said, hundreds of these animals upon the banks of rivers, where they
had come down to the water to drink, and stood gazing at the light.</p>

<p>His cousins could well credit his statements. They themselves had
hunted deer by torchlight in the woods of Louisiana, where it is
termed &ldquo;fire-hunting.&rdquo; They had killed several in this way. The
creatures as if held by some fascination, would stand with head erect
looking at the torch carried by one of the party, while the other took
sight between their glancing eyes and fired the deadly bullet. Remembering
this, they could easily believe that the swans might act
in a similar manner.</p>

<p>It was not long until they were convinced of it by actual experience.
As the canoe rounded a bend in the river, three large white
objects appeared in the &ldquo;reach&rdquo; before them. A single glance satisfied
all that they were swans, though in the deceptive glare of the
torch, they appeared even larger than swans. Their long upright
necks, however, convinced the party they could be nothing else, and
the canoe was headed directly for them.</p>

<p>As our hunters approached, one of the birds was heard to utter
his strange trumpet note, and this he repeated at intervals as they
drew nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard that they sing before death,&rdquo; muttered Fran&ccedil;ois to
Basil, who sat nearest him. &ldquo;If so, I hope that's the song itself;&rdquo;
and Fran&ccedil;ois laughed quietly at the joke he had perpetrated.</p>

<p>Basil also laughed; and Lucien, who had overheard the remark,
could not refrain himself from joining in the laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; rejoined Basil; &ldquo;there is hardly enough music in the
note to call it a song. They may live to 'blow their own trumpet' a
long while yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This remark called forth a fresh chorus of laughter, in which all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
took part; but it was a very silent kind of laughter, that could not
have been heard ten yards off: it might have been termed &ldquo;laughing
in a whisper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It soon ended, however, as matters now became serious: they were
already within less than two hundred yards of the game, and the
greatest caution had to be observed. The gunners had arranged the
order of fire: Basil was to shoot first, taking steady aim with his rifle
at any one of the birds; while Fran&ccedil;ois should fire as soon as he heard
the report of his brother's gun, taking the remaining swans upon the
wing, with one or both barrels, as he best might.</p>

<p>At length Basil deemed himself near enough, and, levelling his piece,
fired. The bird threw out its wings, and flattened down upon the
water, almost without a struggle. The other two were rising into the
air, when &ldquo;crack! crack!&rdquo; went the two barrels of Fran&ccedil;ois' piece,
and one of the swans fell back with a broken wing, and fluttered over
the surface of the stream. Basil's had been shot dead, and was taken
up easily; but the wounded bird was only captured after a long chase
with the canoe; and when overtaken, it struck so fiercely with its
remaining wing, that one of the blows inflicted a painful wound on
the wrist of Fran&ccedil;ois. Both, however, were at length got safely
aboard, and proved to be a male and female of the largest dimensions.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class="cap">&ldquo;CAST AWAY&rdquo;</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>f course, the reports of the guns must have frightened any other
swans that were near. It was not likely they would find any more
before going some distance farther down the river; so, having stowed
away in a safe place the two already killed, the hunters paddled
rapidly onward.</p>

<p>They had hardly gone half-a-mile farther, when another flock of
swans was discovered. These were approached in a similar way, and
no less than three were obtained&mdash;Fran&ccedil;ois making a remarkable
shot, and killing with both barrels. A little farther down, one of the
&ldquo;hoopers&rdquo; was killed; and still farther on, another trumpeter; making
in all no less than seven swans that lay dead in the bottom of the
canoe!</p>

<p>These seven great birds almost filled the little craft to the gunwales,
and you would think that our &ldquo;torch-hunters&rdquo; ought to have
been content with such a spoil; but the hunter is hard to satisfy
with game, and but too often inclined to &ldquo;spill much more blood&rdquo;
than is necessary to his wants. Our voyageurs, instead of desisting,
again set the canoe in motion, and continued the hunt.</p>

<p>A short distance below the place where they had shot the last
swan, as they were rounding a bend in the river, a loud rushing
sounded in their ears, similar to that produced by a cascade or waterfall.
On first hearing it, they were startled and somewhat alarmed.
It might be a &ldquo;fall,&rdquo; thought they. Norman could not tell: he had
never travelled this route; he did not know whether there were falls
in the Red River or not, but he believed not. In his voyage to the
South, he had travelled by another route; that was, up the Winnipeg
River, and through Rainy Lake and the Lake of the Woods to
Lake Superior. This is the usual and well-known track followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
by the <i>employ&eacute;s</i> of the Hudson's Bay Company; and Norman had
travelled it.</p>

<p>In this uncertainty the canoe was brought to a stop, and our
voyageurs remained listening. The noise made by the water was
not very distant, and sounded like the roaring of &ldquo;rapids,&rdquo; or the
rush of a &ldquo;fall.&rdquo; It was evidently one or the other; but, after listening
to it for a considerable time, all came to the conclusion that the
sound did not proceed from the Red River itself, but from some
stream that emptied into it upon the right. With this belief they
again put the canoe in motion, and glided slowly and cautiously
onward.</p>

<p>Their conjecture proved to be correct. As they approached nearer,
they perceived that the noise appeared every moment more and more
to their right; and presently they saw, below them, a rapid current
sweeping into the Red River from the right bank. This was easily
distinguished by the white froth and bubbles that were carried along
upon its surface, and which had evidently been produced by some
fall over which the water had lately passed. The hunters now rowed
fearlessly forward, and in a few moments came opposite the <i>d&eacute;bouchure</i>
of the tributary stream, when a considerable cascade appeared to
their view, not thirty yards from the Red River itself. The water
foamed and dashed over a series of steps, and then swept rapidly on,
in a frothy current. They had entered this current, and were now
carried along with increased velocity, so that the oarsmen suspended
operations, and drew their paddles within the canoe.</p>

<p>A flock of swans now drew their attention. It was the largest
flock they had yet seen, numbering nearly a score of these noble
birds,&mdash;a sight, as Norman informed them, that was exceedingly rare
even in the most favoured haunts of the swan. Rarely are more than
six or seven seen together, and oftener only two or three. A grand
<i>coup</i> was determined upon. Norman took up his own gun, and even
Lucien, who managed the stern oar, and guided the craft, also brought
his piece&mdash;a very small rifle&mdash;close to his hand, so that he might have
a shot as well as the others.</p>

<p>The canoe was directed in such a manner that, by merely keeping
its head down the stream, it would float to the spot where the swans
were.</p>

<p>In a short while they approached very near the great birds, and
our hunters could see them sitting on the water, with upraised necks,
gazing in wonder at the torch. Whether they sounded their strange
note was not known, for the &ldquo;sough&rdquo; of the waterfall still echoed in
the ears of the canoe-men, and they could not hear aught else.</p>

<p>Basil and Norman fired first, and simultaneously; but the louder
detonations of Fran&ccedil;ois' double-barrel, and even the tiny crack of
Lucien's rifle, were heard almost the instant after. Three of the birds
were killed by the volley, while a fourth, evidently &ldquo;winged,&rdquo; was
seen to dive, and flutter down-stream. The others mounted into the
air, and disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>During the time occupied in this man&#339;uvre, the canoe, no longer
guided by Lucien's oar, had been caught by some eddy in the current,
and swept round stern-foremost. In this position the light no longer
shone upon the river ahead, but was thrown up-stream. All in a
downward direction was buried in deep darkness. Before the
voyageurs could bring the canoe back to its proper direction, a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
sound fell upon their ears that caused some of them to utter a cry of
terror. It was the noise of rushing water, but not that which they
had already heard and passed. It was before them in the river itself.
Perhaps it was a cataract, and <i>they were sweeping rapidly to its
brink</i>!</p>

<p>The voice of Norman was heard exclaiming, &ldquo;Hold with your
oars!&mdash;the rapids!&mdash;the rapids!&rdquo; At the same time he himself
was seen rising up and stretching forward for an oar. All was now
consternation; and the movements of the party naturally consequent
upon such a sudden panic shook the little craft until her
gunwales lipped the water. At the same time she had swung round,
until the light again showed the stream ahead, and a horrid
sight it was.</p>

<p>Far as the eye could see, was a reach of foaming rapids. Dark
points of rocks, and huge black boulders, thickly scattered in the
channel, jutted above the surface; and around and against these,
the water frothed and hissed furiously. There was no cataract, it is
true&mdash;there is none such in Red River&mdash;but for all purposes of destruction
the rapids before them were equally dangerous and terrible
to the eyes of our voyageurs. They no longer thought of the swans.
The dead were permitted to float down unheeded, the wounded to
make its escape. Their only thought was to stop the canoe before it
should be carried upon the rapids.</p>

<p>With this intent all had taken to the oars, but in spite of every
exertion they soon found that the light craft had got within the
influence of the strong current, and was sucked downward more
rapidly than ever. Their backward strokes were to no purpose.</p>

<p>In a few seconds the canoe had passed over the first stage of the
rapids, and shot down with the velocity of an arrow. A huge boulder
lay directly in the middle of the channel, and against this the current
broke with fury, laving its sides in foaming masses. The canoe was
hurried to this point; and as the light was again turned up-stream,
none of the voyageurs could see this dangerous rock. But they could
not have shunned it then. The boat had escaped from their control,
and spun round at will. The rock once more came under the light,
but just as the canoe, with a heavy crash, was driven against it.</p>

<p>For some moments the vessel, pressed by the current against the
rock, remained motionless, but her sides were stove in, and the water
was rushing through. The quick eye of Basil&mdash;cool in all crises of
extreme danger&mdash;perceived this at a glance. He saw that the canoe
was a wreck, and nothing remained but to save themselves as they
best might. Dropping the oar, and seizing his rifle, he called to his
companions to leap to the rock; and all together immediately sprang
over the gunwale. The dog Marengo followed after.</p>

<p>The canoe, thus lightened, heeled round into the current, and swept
on. The next moment she struck another rock, and was carried over
on her beams. The water then rushed in&mdash;the white bodies of the
swans, with the robes, blankets, and implements, rose on the wave;
the blazing knots were spilled from the pan, and fell with a hissing
sound; and a few seconds after they were extinguished, and all was
darkness!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<div class="cap">A BRIDGE OF BUCKSKIN</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he canoe was lost, and all it had contained, or nearly all. The
voyageurs had saved only their guns, knives, and the powder-horns
and pouches, that had been attached to their persons. One other
thing had been saved&mdash;an axe which Basil had flung upon the rock
as he stepped out of the sinking vessel. All the rest&mdash;robes, blankets,
swans, cooking utensils, bags of provisions, such as coffee, flour, and
dried meat&mdash;were lost&mdash;irrecoverably lost. These had either drifted
off upon the surface, or been carried under water and hidden among
the loose stones at the bottom. No matter where, they were lost;
and our voyageurs now stood on a small naked rock in the middle of
the stream, with nothing left but the clothes upon their backs, and
the arms in their hands. Such was their condition.</p>

<p>There was something so sudden and awful in the mishap that had
befallen them, that for some minutes they stood upon the spot where
they had settled without moving or addressing a word to one another.
They gazed after the canoe. They knew that it was wrecked, although
they could see nothing either of it or its contents. Thick darkness
enveloped them, rendered more intense from the sudden extinction
of the torchlight. They saw nothing but the foam flickering along
the river; like the ghosts of the swans they had killed, and they
heard only the roaring of the water, that sounded in their ears with
a hoarse and melancholy wail.</p>

<p>For a long time they stood impressed with the lamentable condition
into which the accident had plunged them; and a lamentable condition
it was, sure enough. They were on a small rock in the midst
of a rapid river. They were in the midst of a great wilderness too,
many long miles from a settlement. The nearest could only be
reached by travelling through pathless forests, and over numerous
and deep rivers. Impassable swamps, and lakes with marshy shores,
lay on the route, and barred the direct course, and all this journey
would have to be made on foot.</p>

<p>But none of our young voyageurs were of that stamp to yield themselves
to despair. One and all of them had experienced perils before&mdash;greater
even than that in which they now stood. As soon, therefore,
as they became fully satisfied that their little vessel was wrecked,
and all its contents scattered, instead of despairing, their first thoughts
were how to make the best of their situation.</p>

<p>For that night, at least, they were helpless. They could not leave
the rock. It was surrounded by rapids. Sharp, jagged points
peeped out of the water, and between these the current rushed with
impetuosity. In the darkness no human being could have crossed
to either shore in safety. To attempt it would have been madness,
and our voyageurs soon came to this conclusion. They had no
other choice than to remain where they were until the morning; so,
seating themselves upon the rock, they prepared to pass the night.</p>

<p>They sat huddled close together. They could not lie down&mdash;there
was not room enough for that. They kept awake most of the night,
one or other of them, overcome by fatigue, occasionally nodding over
in a sort of half-sleep, but awaking again after a few minutes' uncomfortable
dreaming. They talked but little, as the noise of the
rushing rapids rendered conversation painful. To be heard, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
were under the necessity of shouting to one another, like passengers
in an omnibus. It was cold, too. None of them had been much
wetted in escaping from the canoe; but they had saved neither
overcoat, blanket, nor buffalo-robe; and, although it was now late
in the spring, the nights near Lake Winnipeg, even at that season,
are chilly. They were above the latitude of 50&deg;; and although in
England, which is on that parallel, it is not very cold of a spring
night, it must be remembered that the line of equal temperature&mdash;in
the language of meteorologists the &ldquo;<i>isothermal line</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;is of a much
lower latitude in America than in Europe.</p>

<p>Our voyageurs were chilled to the very bones, and of course glad
to see the daylight glimmering through the tops of the trees that
grew upon the banks of the river. As soon as day broke, they began
to consider how they would reach those trees. Although swimming
a river of that width would have been to any of the four a mere
bagatelle, they saw that it was not to be so easy an affair. Had
they been upon either bank, they could have crossed to the other
without difficulty&mdash;as they would have chosen a place where the
water was comparatively still. On the rock they had no choice, as
the rapids extended on both sides above and below it. Between
the boulders the current rushed so impetuously, that had they
attempted to swim to either bank, they would have been carried
downward, and perhaps dashed with violence against one or other of
the sharp stones.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light, they saw all this; not without feelings of
apprehension and uneasiness. Their whole attention was now occupied
with the one object&mdash;how they should get to the bank of the
river.</p>

<p>The right bank was the more distant; but the passage in that
direction appeared the easier one. The current was not so swift, nor
yet did it seem so deep. They thought they might ford it, and Basil
made the attempt; but he soon got beyond his depth; and was
obliged, after being carried off his feet, to swim up under the lee of
the rock again.</p>

<p>From the rock to the right bank was about an hundred yards'
distance. Here and there, at irregular intervals, sharp, jagged
stones rose above the surface, some of them projecting three feet or
more out of the water, and looking very much like upright tombstones.
Lucien had noticed these, and expressed the opinion that if
they only had a rope, they might fling it over one of these stones,
and then, holding it fast at the other end, might pass by that means
from one to the other.</p>

<p>The suggestion was a good one, but where was the rope to come
from? All their ropes and cords&mdash;lassoes and all&mdash;had been swept
away in the wreck. Not a string remained, except those that
fastened their horns, flasks, and other accoutrements; and these
were only small thongs, and would be of no use for such a purpose.
It would require a rope strong enough to carry the weight of a man
impelled by a rapid current&mdash;in fact, a weight equal to that of
several men. They all set to thinking how this was to be obtained.
Each looked at the other, and scanned the straps and thongs that
were around their bodies.</p>

<p>They were satisfied at a glance that these would not be sufficient
to make such a rope as was wanted. They did not give up the hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of being able to obtain one. They were all of them accustomed to
resort to strange expedients, and a sufficiently strange one now suggested
itself. Basil and Norman seemed to have thought of it at the
same time, for both at once unbuckled their straps, and commenced
pulling off their buckskin hunting-shirts. The others said nothing,
as they knew well what they were going to do with them&mdash;they
knew they intended cutting them into strips, and then twisting a
rope out of them.</p>

<p>All four set to work together. Lucien and Fran&ccedil;ois held the shirts
taut, while Basil and Norman handled the knives, and in a few
minutes the rock was covered with strips of buckskin about two
inches wide, by a yard or so in length. These were next joined and
plaited together in such a manner that a rope was formed nearly
forty feet long. An eye was made at one end, and through this the
other end was reeved&mdash;so that a running noose was obtained, in the
same manner as the Mexicans and Indians make their lassoes. The
rope was now ready for use, and Basil was the very hand to use it;
for Basil knew how to fling a lasso as well as either Mexican or
Indian. He had practised it often, and had lassoed many a long-horned
bull upon the prairies of Opelousas and the Attakapas. To
Basil, therefore, the rope was given.</p>

<p>He placed himself on the highest part of the rock, having first
coiled the new-made lasso, and hung the coil lightly over his left
arm. He then took the noose-end in his right hand, and commenced
winding it around his head. His companions had laid themselves
flat, so as not to be in the way of the noose as it circled about. After
a few turns the rope was launched forth, and a loud &ldquo;hurrah!&rdquo; from
Fran&ccedil;ois announced that the throw was successful.</p>

<p>It was so in fact, as the noose was seen settling smoothly over the
jutting-stone, taking full hold upon it. A pull from Basil fixed it;
and in a few minutes it was made quite fast, without the slightest
danger of its slipping off. The other end was then carried round a
projecting point of the rock on which they stood, and knotted
firmly, so that the rope was quite taut, and stretched in a nearly
horizontal direction, about a foot above the surface of the water.</p>

<p>The voyageurs now prepared to cross over. Their guns, pouches,
and flasks were carefully secured, so that the water could not
damage them. Then each took a piece of the buckskin thong, and
fastened it round his waist, leaving enough to form a running loop.
This loop was intended to embrace the rope, and run along it, as they
drew themselves forward by their hands.</p>

<p>Basil passed over first. He was the oldest, and, as he asserted, it
was but right he should run the risk in testing the new-fashioned
bridge, of which he was the architect. It worked admirably, and
sustained the weight of his body, with the whole force of the current
acting upon it. Of course he was swept far down, and the rope was
stretched to its full tension, but he succeeded in handing himself
along, until he was able to touch the second rock, and clamber upon
it in safety. During the passage across he was watched by his companions
with emotions of no ordinary character, but as soon as he
had reached the opposite end of the rope all three uttered a loud and
simultaneous cheer. Lucien passed over next, and after him Fran&ccedil;ois.
Notwithstanding his danger, Fran&ccedil;ois laughed loudly all the time he
was in the water, while his brothers were not without some fears for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
his safety. Marengo was next attached to the rope, and pulled
safely over.</p>

<p>Norman was the last to cross upon the buckskin bridge, but, like
the others, he landed in safety; and the four, with the dog, now
stood upon the little isolated boulder where there was just room
enough to give them all a footing.</p>

<p>A difficulty now presented itself, which they had not hitherto
thought of. Another reach of rapid current was to be crossed, before
they could safely trust themselves to enter the water. This they
knew before, but they had also noticed that there was another
jutting rock, upon which they might fling their rope. But the rope
itself was now the difficulty. It was fast at both ends, and how were
they to release it from the rock they had left? One of them could
easily cross over again and untie it, but how was he to get back to
the others? Here was a dilemma which had not presented itself
before, and they now saw themselves no better off than ever. The
rapid that remained to be crossed, was as dangerous as the one they
had succeeded in passing. There was no hope that they could swim
it in safety. They would certainly be swept with violence against
the rocks below. There was no chance, then, of their going an inch
farther&mdash;unless by some means similar to that they had just used,
and the rope was no longer at their service.</p>

<p>For some time they all stood silent, each considering the matter in
his own way. How could they free the rope?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cannot be done,&rdquo; said one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; rejoined another. &ldquo;We must make a second rope.
Fran&ccedil;ois's shirt still remains, and our leggings&mdash;we can use them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the mode suggested by Fran&ccedil;ois and Norman, and Lucien
seemed to assent to it. They had already commenced untying their
leggings, when Basil uttered the ejaculation&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it, brother?&rdquo; asked Lucien.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can free the rope at the other end. At all events, let
me try. It will not cost much, either in time or trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean to do it, brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit close, all of you. Give me room&mdash;you shall see presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As directed by Basil, they all cowered closely down, so as to occupy
as little space as possible. Basil, having uncovered the lock of his
rifle&mdash;which had been carefully bound up in a piece of deer's bladder&mdash;placed
himself in a firm position, and appeared as if about to fire.
Such was his intention&mdash;for in a few moments he was seen to raise
the gun to his shoulder, and take aim. None of his companions
uttered a word. They had already guessed the object of this movement,
and sat silently awaiting the result.</p>

<p>On the rock which they had left, the rope still bound fast passed
around one of the angles, in such a way that, from the point where
Basil stood, it offered a fair mark. It was at this Basil was aiming.
His object was to cut the thong with his bullet. He could not do it
with a single shot, as the thong was broader than the bullet, but he
had calculated that he might effect his purpose with several. If he
did not succeed in cutting it clean through, the ball flattening upon
the rock would, perhaps, tear the rope in such a manner that, by pulling
by the other end, they might detach it. Such were the calculations
and hopes of Basil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>A moment more and the crack of his rifle was heard. At the same
instant the dust rose up from the point at which he had aimed, and
several small fragments flew off into the water. Again was heard
Fran&ccedil;ois's &ldquo;hurrah,&rdquo; for Fran&ccedil;ois, as well as the others, had seen that
the rope had been hit at the right place, and now exhibited a mangled
appearance.</p>

<p>While Basil was reloading, Norman took aim and fired. Norman
was a good shot, though perhaps not so good a one as Basil, for that
was no easy matter, as there were few such marksmen to be found
anywhere, not even among the professional trappers and hunters
themselves. But Norman was a fair shot, and this time hit his mark.
The thong was evidently better than half divided by the two bullets.
Seeing this, Fran&ccedil;ois took hold of the other end, and gave it a strong
jerk or two, but it was still too much for him, and he ceased pulling
and waited the effect of Basil's second shot.</p>

<p>The later had now reloaded, and, taking deliberate aim again, fired.
The rope was still held taut upon the rock, for part of it dragged in
the current, the force of which kept pressing it hard downward.
Scarcely was the report heard, when the farther end of the thong flew
from its fastening, and, swept by the running water, was seen falling
into the lee of the boulder on which the party now stood. A third
time was heard the voice of Fran&ccedil;ois uttering one of his customary
&ldquo;hurrahs.&rdquo; The rope was now dragged up, and made ready for further
use. Basil again took hold of it; and, after coiling it as before, succeeded
in throwing the noose over the third rock, where it settled and
held fast. The other end was tied as before, and all passed safely to
the new station. Here, however, their labour ended. They found
that from this point to the shore the river was shallow, and fordable;
and, leaving the rope where it was, all four took the water, and waded
safely to the bank.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class="cap">DECOYING THE ANTELOPES</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">F</span>or the present, then, our voyageurs had escaped. They were safe
upon the river's bank; but when we consider the circumstances in
which they were placed, we shall perceive that they were far from
being pleasant ones. They were in the midst of a wilderness, without
either horse or boat to carry them out of it. They had lost everything
but their arms and their axe. The hunting-shirts of some of them,
as we have seen, were destroyed, and they would now suffer from the
severe cold that even in summer, as we have said, often reigns in
these latitudes. Not a vessel was left them for cooking with, and not
a morsel of meat or anything was left to be cooked. For their future
subsistence they would have to depend upon their guns, which, with
their ammunition, they had fortunately preserved.</p>

<p>After reaching the shore, their first thoughts were about procuring
something to eat. They had now been a long time without food, and
all four were hungry enough. As if by one impulse, all cast their
eyes around, and looked upward among the branches of the trees, to
see if any animal could be discovered that might serve them for a
meal. Bird or quadruped, it mattered not, so that it was large enough
to give the four a breakfast. But neither one nor the other was to be
seen, although the woods around had a promising appearance. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
trees were large, and as there was much underwood, consisting of
berry-bushes and plants with edible roots, our voyageurs did not
doubt that there would be found game in abundance. It was agreed,
then, that Lucien and Fran&ccedil;ois should remain on the spot and kindle
a fire, while Basil and Norman went off in search of something to be
cooked upon it.</p>

<p>In less than an hour the latter returned, carrying an animal upon his
shoulders, which both the boys recognised as an old acquaintance&mdash;the
prong-horned antelope, so called from the single fork or prong
upon its horns. Norman called it &ldquo;a goat,&rdquo; and stated that this was
its name among the fur-traders, while the Canadian voyageurs give
it the title of &ldquo;cabree.&rdquo; Lucien, However, knew the animal well. He
knew it was not of the goat kind, but a true antelope, and the only
animal of that genus found in North America. Its habitat is the
prairie country, and at the present time it is not found farther east
than the prairies extend, not farther north either, as it is not a
creature that can bear extreme cold.</p>

<p>In early times, however&mdash;that is nearly two centuries ago&mdash;it must
have ranged nearly to the Atlantic shores, as Father Hennipen in his
<i>Travels</i> speaks of &ldquo;goats&rdquo; being killed in the neighbourhood of
Niagara, meaning no other than the prong-horned antelopes. The
true wild goat of America is a very different animal, and is only
found in the remote regions of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>What Norman had shot, then, was an antelope; and the reason
why it is called &ldquo;cabree&rdquo; by the voyageurs, and &ldquo;goat&rdquo; by the fur-traders,
is partly from its colour resembling that of the common goat,
but more from the fact, that along the upper part of its neck there is
a standing mane, which does in truth give it somewhat the appearance
of the European goat. Another point of resemblance lies in the
fact, that the &ldquo;prong-horns&rdquo; emit the same disagreeable odour, which
is a well-known characteristic of the goat species. This proceeds
from two small glandular openings that lie at the angles of the jaws,
and appear spots of a blackish-brown colour.</p>

<p>Both Lucien and Fran&ccedil;ois had shot antelopes. They had decoyed
them within range in their former expedition on the prairies, and had
seen wolves do the same. The Indians usually hunt them in this
manner, by holding up some bright-coloured flag, or other curious
object, which rarely fails to bring them within shot; but Norman
informed his cousins that the Indians of the Hudson's Bay Company
care little about the antelope, and rarely think it worth hunting.
Its skin is of little value to them, and they consider its flesh but indifferent
eating. But the chief reason why they take so little notice
of it is, because it is found in the same range, with the buffalo, the
moose, and the elk; and, as all these animals are more valuable to the
Indian hunter, he allows the antelope to go unmolested, unless when
he is hard pressed with hunger, and none of the others are to be had.</p>

<p>While skinning the antelope for breakfast, Norman amused his
companions by relating how he had killed it. He said he had got
near enough to shoot it by practising a &ldquo;dodge.&rdquo; After travelling
through the woods for some half-mile or so, he had come out into a
country of &ldquo;openings,&rdquo; and saw that there was a large prairie beyond.
He saw that the woods extended no farther than about a mile from
the banks of the river, and that the whole country beyond was without
timber, except in scattered clumps. This is, in fact, true of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Red River country, particularly of its western part, from which the
great prairies stretch westward even to the &ldquo;foot-hills&rdquo; of the Rocky
Mountains.</p>

<p>Well, then, after arriving at the openings, Norman espied a small
herd of antelopes, about ten or a dozen in all. He would rather they
had been something else, as elk or deer; for, like the Indians, he did
not much relish the &ldquo;goat's&rdquo; meat. He was too hungry, however,
to be nice, and so he set about trying to get within shot of the herd.
There was no cover, and he knew he could not approach near enough
without using some stratagem. He therefore laid himself flat upon
his back, and raised his heels as high as he could into the air. These
he kicked about in such a manner as soon to attract the attention of
the antelopes, that, curious to make out what it was, commenced running
round and round in circles, of which Norman himself was the
centre.</p>

<p>The circles gradually became smaller and smaller, until the hunter
saw that his game was within range; when slyly rolling himself
round on one shoulder, he took aim at a buck, and fired. The buck
fell, and the rest of the herd bounded off like the wind. Norman
feeling hungry himself, and knowing that his companions were suffering
from the same cause, lost no time in looking for other game, but
shouldering the &ldquo;goat,&rdquo; carried it into camp.</p>

<p>By this time Lucien and Fran&ccedil;ois had a fire kindled&mdash;a roaring fire
of &ldquo;pine-knots&rdquo;&mdash;and both were standing by it, smoking all over in
their wet leggings. They had got nearly dry when Norman returned,
and they proceeded to assist in butchering the antelope. The skin
was whipped off in a trice; and the venison, cut into steaks and ribs,
was soon spitted and sputtering cheerily in the blaze of the pine-knots.
Everything looked pleasant and promising, and it only wanted
the presence of Basil to make them all feel quite happy again. Basil,
however, did not make his appearance; and as they were all as
hungry as wolves, they could not wait for him, but set upon the
antelope-venison, and made each of them a hearty meal from it.</p>

<p>As yet they had no apprehensions about Basil. They supposed he
had not met with any game, and was still travelling about in search
of it. Should he succeed in killing any, he would bring it in; and
should he not, he would return in proper time without it. It was still
early in the day.</p>

<p>But several hours passed over and he did not come. It was an
unusual length of time for him to be absent, especially in strange
woods of which he knew nothing; moreover, he was in his shirt
sleeves, and the rest of his clothing had been dripping wet when he
set out. Under these circumstances would he remain so long, unless
something unpleasant had happened to him?</p>

<p>This question the three began to ask one another. They began to
grow uneasy about their absent companion; and as the hours passed
on without his appearing, their uneasiness increased to serious alarm.
They at length resolved to go in search of him. They took different
directions, so that there would be a better chance of finding him.
Norman struck out into the woods, while Lucien and Fran&ccedil;ois,
followed by the dog Marengo, kept down the bank&mdash;thinking that
if Basil had got lost, he would make for the river to guide him, as
night approached. All were to return to the camp at nightfall
whether successful or not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>After several hours spent in traversing the woods and openings,
Norman came back. He had been unable to find any traces of their
missing companion. The others had got back before him. They
heard his story with sorrowing hearts, for neither had they fallen in
with the track of living creature. Basil was lost, beyond a doubt.
He would never have stayed so long, had not some accident happened
to him. Perhaps he was dead&mdash;killed by some wild animal&mdash;a
panther or a bear. Perhaps he had met with Indians, who had
carried him off, or put him to death on the spot. Such were the
painful conjectures of his companions.</p>

<p>It was now night. All three sat mournfully over the fire, their
looks and gestures betokening the deep dejection they felt. Although
in need of repose, none of them attempted to go to sleep. At intervals
they discussed the probability of his return, and then they would
remain silent. Nothing could be done that night. They could only
await the morning light, when they would renew their search, and
scour the country in every direction.</p>

<p>It was near midnight, and they were sitting silently around the
fire, when Marengo started to his feet, and uttered three or four loud
barks. The echoes of these had hardly died among the trees when a
shrill whistle was heard at some distance off in the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Fran&ccedil;ois, leaping to his feet at the instant;
&ldquo;that's Basil's whistle, I'll be bound. I'd know it a mile off.
Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois' &ldquo;hurrah!&rdquo; rang through the woods, and the next
moment came back a loud &ldquo;Hilloa!&rdquo; which all recognised as the
voice of Basil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hilloa!&rdquo; shouted the three by the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hilloa, my boys! all right!&rdquo; replied the voice; and a few seconds
after, the tall upright form of Basil himself was seen advancing,
under the glare of the pine-knots. A shout of congratulation was again
raised; and all the party, preceded by Marengo, rushed out to
meet the new-comer. They soon returned, bringing Basil up to the
fire, when it was seen that he had not returned empty-handed. In
one hand he carried a bag of grouse, or &ldquo;prairie hens,&rdquo; while from
the muzzle of his shouldered rifle there hung something that was at
once recognised as a brace of buffalo tongues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Voil&agrave;</i>!&rdquo; cried Basil, flinging down the bag, &ldquo;how are you off for
supper? And here,&rdquo; continued he, pointing to the tongues, &ldquo;here's
a pair of tit-bits that'll make you lick your lips. Come! let us lose
no time in the cooking, for I'm hungry enough to eat either of them
raw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Basil's request was instantly complied with. The fire was raked
up, spits were speedily procured, a tongue and one of the grouse
were roasted; and although Lucien, Fran&ccedil;ois, and Norman, had
already supped on the &ldquo;goat's meat,&rdquo; they set to upon the new viands
with fresh appetites. Basil was hungrier than any, for he had been
all the while fasting. It was not because he was without meat, but
because he knew that his comrades would be uneasy about him, and
he would not stop to cook it. Of meat he had enough, since he had
slain the two buffaloes to which the tongues had belonged; and these
same buffaloes, he now informed them, had been the cause of his long
absence.</p>

<p>Of course, all were eager to know how the buffaloes could have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
delayed him; and therefore, while they were discussing their savoury
supper, Basil narrated the details of his day's adventure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">A &ldquo;PARTRIDGE DANCE.&rdquo;</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">&ldquo;A</span>fter leaving here,&rdquo; said Basil, &ldquo;I struck off through the woods in
a line that led from the river, in a diagonal direction. I hadn't
walked more than three hundred yards, when I heard a drumming
sound, which I at first took to be thunder; but, after listening a
while, I knew it was not that, but the drumming of the ruffed grouse.
As soon as I could ascertain the direction of the sound, I hurried on
in that way; but for a long time I appeared to get no nearer it, so
greatly does this sound deceive one. I should think I walked a full
mile before I arrived at the place where the birds were, for there
were many of them. I then had a full view of them, as they went
through their singular performances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were, in all, about a score. They had selected a piece of
open and level ground, and over this they were running in a circle,
about twenty feet in diameter. They did not all run in the same
direction, but met and crossed each other, although they never
deviated much from the circumference of the circle, around which
the grass was worn quite bare, and a ring upon the turf looked baked
and black. When I first got near, they heard my foot among the
leaves, and I saw that one and all of them stopped running, and
squatted close down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I halted, and hid myself behind a tree. After remaining quiet a
minute or so, the birds began to stretch up their necks, and then all
rose together to their feet, and commenced running round the ring
as before. I knew they were performing what is called the
'Partridge Dance;' and as I had never witnessed it I held back
awhile, and looked on. Even hungry as I was, and as I knew all of
you to be, so odd were the movements of these creatures, that I could
not resist watching them a while, before I sent my unwelcome
messenger into their 'ball-room.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now and then an old cock would separate from the pack, and
running out to some distance, would leap upon a rock that was
there; then, after dropping his wings, flirting with his spread tail,
erecting the ruff upon his neck, and throwing back his head, he
would swell and strut upon the rock, exhibiting himself like a
diminutive turkey-cock. After man&#339;uvring in this way for a few
moments, he would commence flapping his wings in short quick
strokes, which grew more rapid as he proceeded, until a 'booming'
sound was produced, more like the rumble of distant thunder than
anything I can think of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This appeared to be a challenge to the others; and then a second
would come out, and, after replying to it by putting himself through
a similar series of attitudes, the two would attack each other, and
fight with all the fury of a pair of game-cocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could have watched their man&#339;uvres much longer,&rdquo; continued
Basil, &ldquo;but hunger got the better of me, and I made ready to fire.
Those that were 'dancing' moved so quickly round the ring that I
could not sight one of them. If I had had a shot gun, I might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
covered several, but with the rifle I could not hope for more than a
single bird; so, wanting to make sure of that, I waited until an old
cock mounted the rock, and got to 'drumming.' Then I sighted
him, and sent my bullet through his crop. I heard the loud whirr
of the pack as they rose up from the ring; and, marking them, I
saw that they all alighted only a couple of hundred yards off, upon
a large spruce-tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoping they would sit there until I could get another shot, I
loaded, as quickly as possible, and stepped forward. The course I
took brought me past the one I had killed, which I picked up, and
thrust hastily into my bag. Beyond this I had to pass over some
logs that lay along the ground, with level spaces between them.
What was my surprise in getting among these, to see two of the
cocks down upon the grass, and fighting so desperately that they
took no notice of my approach! At first I threw up my rifle,
intending to fire, but seeing that the birds were within a few feet of
me, I thought they might let me lay hold of them, which they, in
fact, did; for the next moment I had 'grabbed' both of them, and
cooled their bellicose spirits by wringing their heads off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I now proceeded to the pack, that still kept the tree. When near
enough, I sheltered myself behind another tree; and taking aim at one,
I brought him tumbling to the ground. The others sat still.
Of course, I shot the one upon the lowest branch: I knew that, so
long as I did this, the others would sit until I might get the whole
of them; but that if I shot one of the upper ones, its fluttering down
through the branches would alarm the rest, and cause them to fly off.
I loaded and fired, and loaded and fired, until half-a-dozen of the
birds lay around the root of the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I could have killed the whole pack, but it just then
occurred to me that I was wasting our precious ammunition, and
that, considering the value of powder and shot to us just now, the
birds were hardly worth a load a-piece; so I left off cracking at
them. As I stepped forward to gather what I had killed, the rest
whirred away into the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On reaching the tree where they had perched, I was very much
surprised to find a raw-hide rope neatly coiled up, and hanging from
one of the lower branches. I knew that somebody must have placed
it there, and I looked round to see what &ldquo;sign&rdquo; there was besides.
My eye fell upon the cinders of an old fire near the foot of the tree;
and I could tell that some Indians had made their camp by it. It
must have been a good while ago, as the ashes were beaten into the
ground by the rain, and, moreover, some young plants were springing
up through them. I concluded, therefore, that whoever had camped
there had hung the rope upon the tree, and on leaving the place had
forgotten it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took the rope down to examine it: it was no other than a lasso,
full fifty feet long, with an iron ring neatly whipped into the loop-end;
and, on trying it with a pull, I saw it was in the best condition.
Of course, I was not likely to leave such a prize behind me. I had
grown, as you may all conceive, to have a very great regard for a
rope, considering that one had just saved all our lives; so I resolved
on bringing the lasso with me. In order to carry it the more conveniently,
I coiled it, and then hung the coil across my shoulders like
a belt. I next packed my game into the bag, which they filled chock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
up to the mouth, and was turning to come back to camp, when my
eye fell upon an object that caused me suddenly to change my
intention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was near the edge of the woods, and through the trunks I could
see a large open space beyond, where there were no trees, or only one
here and there. In the middle of this opening there was a cloud of
dust, and in the thick of it I could see two great dark animals in
motion. They were running about, and now and then coming
together with a sudden rush; and every time they did so, I could
hear a loud thump, like the stroke of a sledge-hammer. The sun was
shining upon the yellow dust-cloud, and the animals appeared from
this circumstance to be of immense size&mdash;much larger than they really
were. Had I not known what kind of creatures were before me, I
should have believed that the mammoths were still in existence. But
I knew well what they were: I had seen many before, carrying on
just such a game. I knew they were buffalo bulls, engaged in one of
their terrible battles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here Basil's narrative was interrupted by a singular incident.
Indeed, it had been interrupted more than once by strange noises
that were heard at some distance off in the woods. These noises were
not all alike: at one time they resembled the barking of a cur dog;
at another, they might have been mistaken for the gurglings of a
person who was being hanged; and then would follow a shriek so
dreadful that for some time the woods would echo with its dismal
sound! After the shriek a laugh would be heard, but a miserable
&ldquo;haw-haw-haw!&rdquo; unlike the laugh of a sane person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All these strange voices were calculated to inspire terror, and so
have they many a time, with travellers not accustomed to the solitary
woods of America. But our young voyageurs were not at all alarmed
by them. They knew from what sort of a creature they proceeded;
they knew they were the varying notes of the great horned-owl; and
as they had seen and heard many a one before, they paid no heed to
this individual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While Basil was going on with his relation, the bird had been
several times seen to glide past, and circle around upon his noiseless
pinions. So easy was his flight, that the slightest inclining of his
spread tail, or the bending of his broad wing, seemed sufficient to
turn and carry him in any direction. Nothing could be more graceful
than his flight, which was not unlike that of the eagle, while he
was but little inferior in size to one of these noble birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What interrupted Basil was, that the owl had alighted upon a
branch not twenty feet from where they were all sitting round the
fire, by the blaze of which they now had a full view of this singular
creature. The moment it alighted, it commenced uttering its hideous
and unmusical cries, at the same time going through such a variety
of contortions, both with its head and body, as to cause the whole
party a fit of laughter. It was, in fact, an odd and interesting sight
to witness its grotesque movements, as it turned first its body, and
then its head around, without moving the shoulders, while its great
honey-coloured eyes glared in the light of the fire. At the end of
every attitude and utterance, it would snap its bill with such violence,
that the cracking of the mandibles upon each other might have been
heard to the distance of several hundred yards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was too much for Fran&ccedil;ois' patience to bear, and he immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
crept to his gun. He had got hold of the piece, and
cocked it; but, just as he was about to take aim, the owl dropped
silently down from the branch, and, gliding gently forward, thrust
out its feathered leg, and lifted one of the grouse in its talons. The
latter had been lying upon the top of a fallen tree not six feet from
the fire! The owl, after clutching it, rose into the air; and the next
moment would have been lost in darkness, but the crack of Fran&ccedil;ois'
rifle put a sudden stop to its flight, and with the grouse still clinging
to its claws it fell fluttering to the earth. Marengo jumped forward
to seize it; but Marengo little knew the sort of creature he had to
deal with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It happened to be only &ldquo;winged,&rdquo; and as soon as the dog came near,
it threw itself upon its back, and struck at him with its talons so
wickedly, that he was fain to approach it with more caution. It cost
Marengo a considerable fight before he succeeded in getting his jaws
over it. During the contest it continually snapped its bill, while its
great goggle eyes kept alternately and quickly opening and closing,
and the feathers being erected all over its body, gave it the appearance
of being twice its real size. Marengo at length succeeded in
&ldquo;crunching&rdquo; it&mdash;although not until he was well scratched about the
snout&mdash;and its useless carcass having been thrown upon the ground,
the dog continued to worry and chew at it, while Basil went on with
his narration.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class="cap">BASIL AND THE BISON-BULL.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">&ldquo;A</span>s soon as I saw the buffaloes,&rdquo; continued Basil, &ldquo;my first thought
was to get near, and have a shot at them. <i>They</i> were worth a charge
of powder and lead, and I reflected that if I could kill but one of
them, it would ensure us against hunger for a couple of weeks to
come. So I hung my game-bag to the branch of a tree, and set about
approaching them. I saw that the wind was in my favour, and there
was no danger of their scenting me. But there was no cover near
them&mdash;the ground was as level as a table, and there was not a score
of trees upon as many acres. It was no use crawling up, and I did
not attempt it, but walked straight forward, treading lightly as I
went. In five minutes, I found myself within good shooting range.
Neither of the bulls had noticed me. They were too busy with one
another, and in all my life I never saw two creatures fighting in such
earnest. They were foaming at the mouth, and the steam poured out
of their nostrils incessantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At times, they would back from each other like a pair of rams, and
then rush together head-foremost, until their skulls cracked with the
terrible collision. One would have fancied that they would break
them at every fresh encounter, but I knew the thickness of a buffalo's
skull before that time. I remember having fired a musket at one
that stood fronting me not more than six feet distant, when, to my
surprise, the bullet flattened and fell to the ground before the nose of
the buffalo! The creature was not less astonished than myself, as
up to that time it had not seen me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Basil after a pause, &ldquo;I did not stop long to watch
the battle of the bison-bulls. I was not curious about that. I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
seen such many a time. I was thinking about the meat; and I
paused just long enough to select the one that appeared to have the
most fat upon his flanks, when I drew up my rifle and fired. I aimed
for the heart, and my aim was a true one, for the animal came to its
knees along with the crack. Just at that moment the other was
charging upon it, and, to my surprise, it continued to run on, until
striking the wounded one full butt upon the forehead, it knocked the
latter right over upon its side; where, after giving half-a-dozen kicks,
it lay quite dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The remaining bull had dashed some paces beyond the spot, and
now turned round again to renew his attack. On seeing his antagonist
stretched out and motionless, he seemed to be as much
astonished as I was. At first, no doubt, he fancied himself the author
of a grand <i>coup</i>, for it was plain that up to this time he had neither
noticed my presence, nor the report of the rifle. The bellowing
noise that both were making had drowned the latter; and the dust,
together with the long shaggy tufts that hung over his eyes, had
prevented him from seeing anything more than his rival, with whom
he was engaged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that the other was no longer able to stand before him, and
thinking it was himself that had done the deed, he tossed up his
head and snorted in triumph. At this moment, the matted hair was
thrown back from his eyes, and the dust having somewhat settled
away, he sighted me, where I stood reloading my gun. I fancied he
would take off before I could finish, and I made all the haste in my
power&mdash;so much so that I dropped the box of caps at my feet. I
had taken one out, however, and hurriedly adjusted it, thinking to
myself, as I did so, that the box might lie where it was until I had
finished the job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought the piece to my shoulder, when, to my surprise, the bull,
instead of running away, as I had expected, set his head, and
uttering one of his terrible bellows, came rushing towards me. I
fired, but the shot was a random one, and though it hit him in the
snout, it did not in the least disable him. Instead of keeping him
off, it only seemed to irritate him the more, and his fury was now at
its height.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no time to load again. He was within a few feet of me when
I fired, and it was with difficulty that, by leaping to one side, I
avoided his horns; but I did so, and he passed me with such violence
that I felt the ground shake under his heavy tread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wheeled immediately, and made at me a second time. I knew
that if he once touched me I was gone. His horns were set, and his
eyes glared with a terrible earnestness. I rushed towards the body
of the buffalo that lay near, hoping that this might assist me in avoiding
the onset. It did so, for, as he dashed forward over it, he became
entangled among the limbs, and again charged without striking me.
He turned, however, as quick as thought, and again rushed bellowing
upon me. There was a tree near at hand. I had noticed it before,
but I could not tell whether I should have time to reach it. I
was now somewhat nearer it, and, fearing that I might not be able
to dodge the furious brute any longer upon the ground, I struck out
for the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be sure I did my best at running. I heard the bull
coming after, but before he could overtake me, I had got to the root<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of the tree. It was my intention, at first, only to take shelter behind
the trunk; but when I had got there, I noticed that there were some
low branches, and catching one of these I swung myself up among
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus-050.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="BASIL AND THE BISON-BULL." title="BASIL AND THE BISON-BULL." />
<span class="caption">BASIL AND THE BISON-BULL.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The bull passed under me with a rush&mdash;almost touching my feet
as I hung by the branch&mdash;but I was soon safely lodged in a fork, and
out of his reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My next thought was to load my gun, and fire at him from my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
perch, and, with this intention, I commenced loading. I had no fear
but that he would give me an opportunity, for he kept round the
tree, and at times attacked the trunk, butting and goring it with
his horns, and all the while bellowing furiously. The tree was a
small one, and it shook so, that I began to fear it might break down.
I therefore made all the haste I could to get in the load, expecting
soon to put an end to his attacks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I succeeded at length in ramming down the bullet, and was just
turning the gun to put on a cap, when I recollected that the cap-box
was still lying on the ground where it had fallen! The sudden
attack of the animal had prevented me from taking it up. My caps
were all within that box, and my gun, loaded though it was, was as
useless in my hands as a bar of iron. To get at the caps would be
quite impossible. I dared not descend from the tree. The infuriated
bull still kept pacing under it, now going round and round, and
occasionally stopping for a moment and looking angrily up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My situation was anything but a pleasant one. I began to fear
that I might not be permitted to escape at all. The bull seemed to
be most pertinacious in vengeance. I could have shot him in the
back, or the neck, or where I liked, if I had only one cap. He was
within three feet of the muzzle of my rifle; but what of that when I
could not get the gun to go off? After a while I thought of making
some tinder paper, and then trying to 'touch off' the piece with
it, but a far better plan at that moment came into my head. While
I was fumbling about my bullet-pouch to get at my flint and steel,
of course my fingers came into contact with the lasso, which was still
hanging around my shoulders. It was this that suggested my plan,
which was no other than to <i>lasso the bull, and tie him to the tree</i>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost no time in carrying it into execution. I uncoiled the rope,
and first made one end fast to the trunk. The other was the loop-end,
and reeving it through the ring, I held it in my right hand while
I leaned over and watched my opportunity. It was not long before
a good one offered. The bull still continued his angry demonstrations
below, and passed round and round. It was no new thing for me to
fling a lasso, and at the first pitch I had the satisfaction of seeing the
noose pass over the bison's head, and settle in a proper position
behind his horns. I then gave it a twitch, so as to tighten it, and
after that I ran the rope over a branch, and thus getting 'a purchase'
upon it, I pulled it with all my might.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as the bull felt the strange cravat around his neck, he
began to plunge and 'rout' with violence, and at length ran furiously
out from the tree. But he soon came to the end of his tether; and
the quick jerk, which caused the tree itself to crack, brought him to
his haunches, while the noose tightening on his throat was fast
strangling him. But for the thick matted hair it would have done
so, but this saved him, and he continued to sprawl and struggle at
the end of the rope. The tree kept on cracking, and as I began to
fear that it might give way and precipitate me to the ground, I
thought it better to slip down. I ran direct to where I had dropped
the caps; and, having got hold of the box, I soon had one upon my
gun. I then stole cautiously back, and while the bison was hanging
himself as fast as he could, I brought his struggles to a period by
sending a bullet through his ribs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it was quite night when I had finished the business, of course I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
could not stay to butcher the bulls. I knew that you would be
wondering what kept me, so I cut out the tongues, and coming by
the place where I had left the grouse, brought them along. I left a
'scare-wolf' over both the bulls, however, and I guess we'll find them
all right in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Basil having finished the narration of his day's adventures, fresh
fuel was heaped on the embers, and a huge fire was built&mdash;one that
would last until morning. This was necessary, as none of them had
now either blankets or bedding. Basil himself and Norman were
even in their shirt-sleeves, and of course their only chance for
keeping warmth in their bodies would be to keep up a roaring fire
all the night. This they did, and all four laying themselves close
together, slept soundly enough.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="cap">THREE CURIOUS TREES.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">N</span>ext morning they were awake at an early hour. There was still
enough of the tongues and grouse left, along with some ribs of the
antelope, to breakfast the party; and then all four set out to bring
the flesh of Basil's buffaloes into camp. This they accomplished,
after making several journeys. It was their intention to dry the
meat over the fire, so that it might keep for future use. For this
purpose the flesh was removed from the bones, and after being cut
into thin slices and strips, was hung up on poles at some distance
from the blaze. Nothing more could be done, but wait until it
became sufficiently parched by the heat.</p>

<p>While this process was going on our voyageurs collected around
the fire, and entered into a consultation about what was best to be
done. At first they thought of going back to the Red River settlement,
and obtaining another canoe, as well as a fresh stock of provisions
and implements. But they all believed that getting back
would be a toilsome and difficult matter. There was a large lake and
several extensive marshes on the route, and these would have to be
got round, making the journey a very long one indeed. It would
take them days to perform it on foot, and nothing is more discouraging
on a journey than to be forced by some accident to what is
called &ldquo;taking the back-track.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of them acknowledged this, but what else could they do? It is
true there was a post of the Hudson's Bay Company at the northern
end of Lake Winnipeg. This post was called Norway House. How
were they to reach that afoot? To walk around the borders of the
lake would be a distance of more than four hundred miles. There
would be numerous rivers to cross, as well as swamps and pathless
forests to be threaded. Such a journey would occupy a month or
more, and at Norway House they would still be as it were only at the
beginning of the great journey on which they had set out. Moreover,
Norway House lay entirely out of their way. Cumberland House&mdash;another
trading-post upon the River Saskatchewan&mdash;was the next
point where they had intended to rest themselves, after leaving the Red
River settlements. To reach Cumberland House <i>afoot</i> would be equally
difficult, as it, too, lay at the distance of hundreds of miles, with lakes,
and rivers, and marshes, intervening. What, then, could they do?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us <i>not</i> go back,&rdquo; cried Fran&ccedil;ois, ever ready with a bold advice:
&ldquo;let us make a boat, and keep on, say I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! Fran&ccedil;ois,&rdquo; rejoined Basil, &ldquo;it's easy to say 'make a boat;'
how is that to be done, I pray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what's to hinder us to hew a log, and make a dug-out? We
have still got the axe, and two hatchets left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Norman asked what Fran&ccedil;ois meant by a dug-out. The phrase
was new to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A canoe,&rdquo; replied Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;hollowed out of a tree. They are
sometimes called 'dug-outs' on the Mississippi, especially when they
are roughly made. One of them, I think, would carry all four of us
well enough. Don't you think so, Luce?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; answered the student; &ldquo;a large one might: but I fear
there are no trees about here of sufficient size. We are not among
the great timber of the Mississippi bottom, you must remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How large a tree would it require?&rdquo; asked Norman, who knew
but little of this kind of craft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three feet in diameter, at least,&rdquo; replied Lucien; &ldquo;and it should
be of that thickness for a length of nearly twenty feet. A less one
would not carry four of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am sure enough,&rdquo; responded Norman, &ldquo;that we won't find
such timber here. I have seen no tree of that size either yesterday,
or while we were out this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; added Basil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe there's one,&rdquo; said Lucien.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we were in Louisiana,&rdquo; rejoined Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;I could find fifty
canoe-trees by walking as many yards. Why I never saw such insignificant
timber as this here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll see smaller timber than this Cousin Frank, before we reach
the end of our voyage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This remark was made by Norman, who knew that, as they proceeded
northward, the trees would be found decreasing in size until
they would appear like garden shrubbery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But come,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;if we can't build a craft to carry us
from <i>one</i> tree, perhaps we can do it out of <i>three</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With three!&rdquo; echoed Fran&ccedil;ois. &ldquo;I should like to see a canoe
made from three trees! Is it a raft you mean, Cousin Norman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded the other; &ldquo;a canoe, and one that will serve us for
the rest of our voyage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All three&mdash;Basil, Lucien, and Fran&ccedil;ois&mdash;looked to their cousin for
an explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would rather not go back up the river?&rdquo; he inquired, glancing
from one to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wish to go on&mdash;all of us,&rdquo; answered Basil, speaking for his
brothers as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; assented the young fur-trader; &ldquo;I think it is better
as you wish it. Out of these trees I can build a boat that will carry
us. It will take us some days to do it, and some time to find the
timber, but I am tolerably certain it is to be found in these woods.
To do the job properly I want three kinds; two of them I can see
from where I sit; the third I expect will be got in the hills we saw
this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Norman spoke he pointed to two trees that grew among many
others not far from the spot. These trees were of very different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
kinds, as was easily told by their leaves and bark. The nearer and
more conspicuous of them at once excited the curiosity of the three
Southerners. Lucien recognised it from its botanical description.
Even Basil and Fran&ccedil;ois, though they had never seen it, as it is not
to be found in the hot clime of Louisiana, knew it from the accounts
given of it by travellers. The tree was the celebrated &ldquo;canoe-birch,&rdquo;
or as Lucien named it, &ldquo;paper-birch,&rdquo; celebrated as the tree out of
whose bark those beautiful canoes are made that carry thousands of
Indians over the interior lakes and rivers of North America; out of
whose bark whole tribes of these people fashion their bowls, their
pails, and their baskets; with which they cover their tents, and from
which they even make their soup-kettles and boiling-pots! This,
then, was the canoe birch-tree, so much talked of, and so valuable to
the poor Indians who inhabit the cold regions where it grows.</p>

<p>Our young Southerners contemplated the tree with feelings of
interest and curiosity. They saw that it was about sixty feet high,
and somewhat more than a foot in diameter. Its leaves were nearly
cordate, or heart-shaped, and of a very dark-green colour; but that
which rendered it most conspicuous among the other trees of the
forest was the shining white or silver-coloured bark that covered its
trunk, and its numerous slender branches. This bark is only white
externally. When you have cut through the epidermis you find it of
a reddish tinge, very thick, and capable of being divided into several
layers. The wood of the tree makes excellent fuel, and is also often used
for articles of furniture. It has a close, shining grain, and is strong
enough for ordinary implements; but if exposed to the weather will
decay rapidly.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;canoe-birch&rdquo; is not the only species of these trees found in
North America. The genus <i>Betula</i> (so called from the Celtic word
<i>batu</i>, which means birch) has at least half-a-dozen other known representatives
in these parts. There is the &ldquo;white birch,&rdquo; a worthless
tree of some twenty feet in height, and less than six inches diameter.
The bark of this species is useless, and its wood, which is soft and
white, is unfit even for fuel. It grows, however, in the poorest soil.
Next there is a species called the &ldquo;cherry-birch,&rdquo; so named from the
resemblance of its bark to the common cherry-tree. It is also called
&ldquo;sweet birch,&rdquo; because its young twigs, when crushed, give out a
pleasant aromatic odour. Sometimes the name of &ldquo;black birch,&rdquo; is
given to this species. It is a tree of fifty or sixty feet in height, and
its wood is much used in cabinet-work, as it is close-grained, of a
beautiful reddish colour, and susceptible of a high polish.</p>

<p>The information regarding the birches of America was given by
Lucien to his brothers, not at that time, but shortly afterward, when
the three were engaged in felling one of these trees. Just then
other matters occupied them, and they had only glanced, first at the
canoe-birch and then at the other tree which Norman had pointed
out. The latter was of a different genus. It belonged to the order
<i>Conifer&aelig;</i>, or cone-bearing trees, as was evident from the cone-shaped
fruits that hung upon its branches, as well as from its needle-like
evergreen leaves.</p>

<p>The cone-bearing trees of America are divided by botanists into
three great sub-orders&mdash;the <i>Pines</i>, the <i>Cypresses</i> and the <i>Yews</i>. Each
of these includes several genera. By the &ldquo;pine tribe&rdquo; is meant all
those trees known commonly by the names pine, spruce, fir, and larch:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
while the <i>Cupressin&aelig;</i>, or cypress tribe, are the cypress proper, the
cedars, the arbor-vit&aelig;, and the junipers. The yew tribe has fewer
genera or species; but the trees in America known as yews and hemlocks&mdash;of
which there are several varieties&mdash;belong to it.</p>

<p>The pines cannot be termed trees of the tropics, yet do they grow
in southern and warm countries. In the Carolinas, tar and turpentine,
products of the pine, are two staple articles of exportation; and
even under the equator itself, the high mountains are covered with
pine-forests. But the pine is more especially the tree of a northern
<i>sylva</i>. As you approach the Arctic circle, it becomes the characteristic
tree. Then it appears in extensive forests, lending their picturesque
shelter to the snowy desolation of the earth. One species of
pine is the very last tree that disappears as the traveller, in approaching
the pole, takes his leave of the limits of vegetation. This species
is the &ldquo;white spruce&rdquo; the very one which, along with the birch-tree,
had been pointed out by Norman to his companions.</p>

<p>It was a tree not over thirty or forty feet high, with a trunk of less
than a foot in thickness, and of a brownish colour. Its leaves or
&ldquo;needles&rdquo; were about an inch in length, very slender and acute, and
of a bluish green tint. The cones upon it, which at that season were
young were of a pale green. When ripe, however, they become rusty-brown,
and are nearly two inches in length.</p>

<p>What use Norman would make of this tree in building his canoe,
neither Basil nor Fran&ccedil;ois knew. Lucien only guessed at it. Fran&ccedil;ois
asked the question, by saying that he supposed the &ldquo;timbers&rdquo; were
to come out of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;for that I want still another sort. If I can't
find that sort, however, I can manage to do without it, but not so
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What other sort?&rdquo; demanded Fran&ccedil;ois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want some cedar-wood,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! that's for the timbers,&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois; &ldquo;I am sure of it.
The cedar-wood is lighter than any other, and, I dare say, would
answer admirably for ribs and other timbers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right this time, Frank&mdash;it is considered the best for that
purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think there are cedar-trees on the hills we saw this morning?&rdquo;
said Fran&ccedil;ois, addressing his Canadian cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so. I noticed something like them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I, too, observed a dark foliage,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;which looked
like the cedar. If anywhere in this neighbourhood, we shall find
them there. They usually grow upon rocky, sterile hills, such as
those appear to be&mdash;that is their proper situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question,&rdquo; remarked Basil, &ldquo;ought to be settled at once.
We have made up our mind to the building of a canoe, and I think
we should lose no time in getting ready the materials. Suppose we
all set out for the hills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreed&mdash;agreed!&rdquo; shouted the others with one voice; and then
shouldering their guns, and taking the axe along, all four set out for
the hills. On reaching these, the object of their search was at once
discovered. The tops of all the hills&mdash;dry, barren ridges they were&mdash;were
covered with a thick grove of the red cedar. The trees were
easily distinguished by the numerous branches spreading horizontally,
and thickly covered with short dark green needles, giving them that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
sombre, shady appearance, that makes them the favourite haunt of
many species of owls. Their beautiful reddish wood was well known
to all the party, as it is to almost every one in the civilized world.
Everybody who has seen or used a black-lead pencil must know what
the wood of the red cedar is like&mdash;for it is in this the black-lead is
usually incased. In all parts of America, where this tree grows in
plenty, it is employed for posts and fence-rails, as it is one of the
most durable woods in existence. It is a great favourite also for
kindling fires, as it catches quickly, and blazes up in a few seconds,
so as to ignite the heavier logs of other timbers, such as the oak and
the pine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Norman, after examining a few of the cedar-trees,
&ldquo;we have here all that's wanted to make our canoe. We need lose
no more time, but go to work at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied the three brothers, &ldquo;we are ready to assist
you,&mdash;tell us what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I think we had better change
our camp to this spot, as I see all the different kinds of trees here,
and much better ones than those near the river. There,&rdquo; continued
he, pointing to a piece of moist ground in the valley,&mdash;&ldquo;there are
some splendid birches, and there beside them is plenty of the <i>&eacute;pinette</i>&rdquo;
(so the voyageurs term the white spruce). &ldquo;It will save us many
journeys if we go back and bring our meat to this place at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this they all of course agreed, and started back to their first
camp. They soon returned with the meat and other things, and
having chosen a clean spot under a large-spreading cedar-tree, they
kindled a new fire and made their camp by it&mdash;that is, they strung
up the provisions, hung their horns and pouches upon the branches
around, and rested their guns against the trees. They had no tent
to pitch, but that is not necessary to constitute a camp. In the
phraseology of the American hunter, wherever you kindle your fire
or spend the night is a &ldquo;camp.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="cap">HOW TO BUILD A BARK CANOE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">N</span>orman expected that they would be able to finish the canoe in
about a week. Of course, the sooner the better, and no time was
lost in setting about it. The ribs or &ldquo;timbers&rdquo; were the first thing
to be fashioned, and a number of straight branches of cedar were
cut, out of which they were to be made. These branches were cleared
of twigs, and rendered of an equal thickness at both ends. They
were then flattened with the knife; and, by means of a little sweating
in the ashes, were bent so as to bear some resemblance in shape to
the wooden ox-yokes commonly used in America, or indeed to the
letter U.</p>

<p>The ribs when thus bent were not all of the same width. On the
contrary, those which were intended to be placed near the middle or
gangway of the vessel, were about two feet across from side to side,
while the space between the sides of the others was gradually less
in each fresh pair, according as their position was to be near to the
stem and stern. When the whole of them had been forced into the
proper shape, they were placed, one inside the other after the manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
of dishes, and then all were firmly lashed together, and left to dry.
When the lashing should be removed, they would hold to the
form thus given them, and would be ready for fastening to the
kelson.</p>

<p>While Norman was occupied with the timbers the others were not
idle. Basil had cut down several of the largest and straightest
birches, and Lucien employed himself in carefully removing the bark
and cleansing it of nodules and other inequalities. The broad sheets
were suspended by a smoke fire, so as completely to dry up the sap,
and render it tough and elastic. Fran&ccedil;ois had his part to play, and
that was to collect the resinous gum which was distilled in plenty
from the trunks of the &eacute;pinette or spruce-trees.</p>

<p>This gum is a species of pitch, and is one of the most necessary
materials in the making of a bark canoe. It is used for &ldquo;paying&rdquo;
the seams, as well as any cracks that may show themselves in the
bark itself; and without it, or some similar substance, it would be
difficult to make one of these little vessels water-tight. But that is
not the only thing for which the &eacute;pinette is valued in canoe-building;
far from it. This tree produces another indispensable material; its
long fibrous roots when split, form the twine-like threads by which
the pieces of bark are sewed to each other and fastened to the timbers.
These threads are as strong as the best cords of hemp, and are
known among the Indians by the name of &ldquo;watap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a country, therefore, where hemp and flax cannot be readily
procured, the &ldquo;watap&rdquo; is of great value. You may say that deer are
plenty, and that thongs of buckskin would serve the same purpose.
This, however, is not the case. The buckskin would never do for
such a use. The moment it becomes wet it is liable to stretch, so
that the seams would open and the canoe get filled with water. The watap,
wet or dry, does not yield, and has therefore been found to be
the best thing of all others for this purpose.</p>

<p>The only parts now wanted were the gunwale and the bottom.
The former was easily obtained. Two long poles, each twenty feet
in length, were bent somewhat like a pair of bows, and then placed
with their convex sides towards each other, and firmly lashed together
at the ends. This was the gunwale. The bottom was the most
difficult part of all. For that a solid plank was required, and they
had no saw. The axe and the hatchet, however, were called into
requisition, and a log was soon hewn and thinned down to the
proper dimensions. It was sharpened off at the ends, so as to run to
a very acute angle, both at the stem and stern.</p>

<p>When the bottom was considered sufficiently polished, and modelled
to the right shape, the most difficult part of the undertaking was
supposed to be accomplished. A few long poles were cut and
trimmed flat. These were to be laid longitudinally between the
ribs and the bark, somewhat after the fashion of laths in the roofing
of a house. Their use was to prevent the bark from splitting. The
materials were now all obtained complete, and, with a few days'
smoking and drying, would be ready for putting together.</p>

<p>While waiting for the timbers to dry, paddles were made, and
Norman, with the help of the others, prepared what he jokingly
called his &ldquo;dock,&rdquo; and also his &ldquo;ship-yard.&rdquo; This was neither more
nor less than a long mound of earth&mdash;not unlike a new-made grave,
only three times the length of one, or even longer. It was flat upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the top, and graded with earth so as to be quite level and free from
inequalities.</p>

<p>At length all the materials were considered quite ready for use,
and Norman went to work to put them together.</p>

<p>His first operation was to untie the bundle of timbers, and separate
them. They were found to have taken the exact form into which
they had been bent, and the thongs being no longer necessary to
keep them in place, were removed. The timbers themselves were
next placed upon the bottom or kelson, those with the widest bottoms
being nearer to &ldquo;midships,&rdquo; while those with the narrower bend were
set towards the narrower ends of the plank. Thus placed, they were
all firmly lashed with strong cords of watap, by means of holes pierced
in the bottom plank.</p>

<p>Fortunately Lucien happened to have a pocket-knife, in which
there was a good awl or piercer, that enabled them to make these
holes&mdash;else the matter would have been a much more difficult one,
as an awl is one of the most essential tools in the construction of a
bark canoe. Of course it took Norman a considerable time to set all
the ribs in their proper places, and fasten them securely; but he was
ably assisted by Fran&ccedil;ois, who waited upon him with much diligence,
handing him now the awl, and then the watap, whenever he required
them.</p>

<p>Norman's next operation was the laying of his kelson &ldquo;in dock.&rdquo;
The timbers being attached to it, it was lifted up on the earthen
mound, where it reached quite from end to end. Half-a-dozen large
heavy stones were then placed upon it, so that, pressed down by these
upon the even surface of the mould, it was rendered quite firm; and,
moreover, was of such a height from the ground that the young shipwright
could work upon it without too much bending and kneeling.</p>

<p>The gunwale, already prepared, was next placed so as to touch the
ends of the ribs all round, and these ends were adjusted to it with
great nicety, and firmly joined. Strong cross-pieces were fixed, which
were designed, not only to keep the gunwale from spreading or contracting,
but afterwards to serve as seats.</p>

<p>Of course the gunwale formed the complete mouth, or upper edge
of the canoe. It was several feet longer than the bottom plank, and,
when in place, projected beyond the ribs at both ends. From each
end of the bottom plank, therefore, to the corresponding end of the
gunwale, a straight piece of wood was stretched, and fastened. One
of these pieces would form the stem or cutwater, while the other
would become the stern of the craft. The long poles were next laid
longitudinally upon the ribs outside, and lashed in their places; and
this done, the skeleton was completed, ready for the bark.</p>

<p>The latter had been already cut to the proper dimensions and
shape. It consisted of oblong pieces&mdash;each piece being a regular
parallelogram, as it had been stripped from the tree. These were
laid upon the ribs longitudinally, and then sewed to the edge of the
bottom plank, and also to the gunwale. The bark itself was in such
broad pieces that two of them were sufficient to cover half a side, so
that but one seam was required lengthwise, in addition to the
fastenings at the top and bottom. Two lengths of the bark also
reached cleverly from stem to stern, and thus required only one
transverse seam on each side. There was an advantage in this
arrangement, for where the birch-bark can only be obtained in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
small flakes, a great number of seams is a necessary consequence, and
then it is extremely difficult to keep the canoe from leaking. Thanks
to the fine birch-trees, that grew in abundance around, our boat-builders
had procured the very best bark.</p>

<p>The canoe was now completed all but the &ldquo;paying,&rdquo; and that
would not take long to do. The gum of the &eacute;pinette had to be boiled,
and mixed with a little grease, so as to form a species of wax. For
this the fat already obtained from the buffaloes was the very thing;
and a small tin cup which Basil had saved from the wreck (it had
been strung to his bullet-pouch), enabled them to melt the gum, and
apply it hot. In less than an hour the thing was done. Every
crack and awl-hole was payed, and the canoe was pronounced
&ldquo;water-tight,&rdquo; and, as Fran&ccedil;ois added, with a laugh, &ldquo;seaworthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A small pond was near, at the bottom of the hill: Fran&ccedil;ois espied
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, boys,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;a launch! a launch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was agreed to by all. The great stones were taken out.
Basil and Norman, going one to the stem the other to the stern,
lifted the canoe from the &ldquo;dock,&rdquo; and, raising it upon their shoulders,
carried it down to the pond. The next moment it was pushed into
the water, where it floated like a cork. A loud cheer was given, in
which even Marengo joined; and a salute was then fired&mdash;a full
broadside&mdash;from the four guns. Fran&ccedil;ois, to complete the thing,
seized one of the paddles, and leaping into the canoe, shot the little
craft out upon the bosom of the pond, cheering all the while like one
frantic.</p>

<p>After amusing himself for some minutes, he paddled back to the
shore, when they all looked eagerly into the canoe, and perceived to
their gratification that not as much as a drop of water had leaked
during the &ldquo;trip.&rdquo; Thanks and congratulations now greeted Norman
from every side; and, taking their vessel from the water, the young
voyageurs returned to their camp, to regale themselves with a grand
dinner, which Lucien had cooked for the occasion.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class="cap">THE CHAIN OF LAKES</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>ur young voyageurs now prepared to resume their journey. While
Norman was engaged in building his canoe, with his assistant,
Fran&ccedil;ois, the others had not been idle. Basil was, of course, the
hunter of the party; and, in addition to the small game, such as
hares, geese, and grouse, he had killed three caribou, of the large
variety known as &ldquo;woodland caribou.&rdquo; These are a species of the
reindeer of which I have more to say hereafter. Lucien had attended
to the drying of their flesh; and there was enough of it still left, as
our voyageurs believed, to supply their wants until they should reach
Cumberland House, where they would, of course, procure a fresh
stock of provisions. The skins of the caribou had also been scraped
and dressed by Lucien&mdash;who understood the process well&mdash;and these,
with the skin of the antelope, were sufficient to make a pair of
hunting-shirts for Basil and Norman, who, it will be remembered,
had lost theirs by cutting them up.</p>

<p>Next morning the canoe was launched upon the river&mdash;below the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
rapids&mdash;and the dried meat, with their other matters, snugly stowed
in the stern. Then the young voyageurs got in, and, seating themselves
in their places, seized hold of the paddles. The next moment
the canoe shot out into the stream; and a triumphant cheer from the
crew announced that they had recommenced their journey. They found
to their delight that the little vessel behaved admirably&mdash;shooting
through the water like an arrow, and leaking not water enough, as
Fran&ccedil;ois expressed it, &ldquo;to drown a mosquito.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had all taken their seats in the order which had been agreed
upon for the day. Norman was &ldquo;bowsman,&rdquo; and, of course, sat in
the bow. This, among the regular Canadian voyageurs, is esteemed
the post of honour, and the bowsman is usually styled &ldquo;Captain&rdquo;
by the rest of the crew. It is also the post that requires the greatest
amount of skill on the part of its occupant, particularly where there
are rapids or shoals to be avoided. The post of &ldquo;steersman&rdquo; is also
one of honour and importance; and both steersman and bowsman
receive higher wages than the other voyageurs who pass under the
name of &ldquo;middlemen.&rdquo; The steersman sits in the stern, and that
place was now occupied by Lucien, who had proved himself an excellent
steersman. Basil and Fran&ccedil;ois were, of course, the &ldquo;middlemen,&rdquo;
and plied the paddles.</p>

<p>This was the arrangement made for the day; but although on other
days the programme was to be changed, so as to relieve Basil and
Fran&ccedil;ois, on all occasions when there were rapids or other difficulties
to be encountered they were to return to this order. Norman, of
course, understood canoe navigation better than his Southern cousins;
and therefore, by universal assent, he was acknowledged &ldquo;the
Captain,&rdquo; and Fran&ccedil;ois always addressed him as such. Lucien's
claim to the post of second honour was admitted to be just, as he had
proved himself capable of filling it to the satisfaction of all. Marengo
had no post, but lay quietly upon the buffalo skin between Lucien's
legs, and listened to the conversation without joining in it, or in any
way interfering in the working of the vessel.</p>

<p>In a few hours our voyageurs had passed through the low marshy
country that lies around the mouth of the Red River, and the white
expanse of the great Lake Winnipeg opened before them, stretching
northward far beyond the range of their vision. Norman knew the
lake, having crossed it before, but its aspect somewhat disappointed
the Southern travellers. Instead of a vast dark lake which they had
expected to see, they looked upon a whitish muddy sheet, that presented
but few attractive points to the eye, either in the hue of its
water or the scenery of its shores.</p>

<p>These, so far as they could see them, were low, and apparently
marshy; and this is, in fact, the character of the southern shores of
Winnipeg. On its east and north, however, the country is of a different
character. There the geological formation is what is termed
<i>primitive</i>. The rocks consist of granite, sienite, gneiss, &amp;c.; and, as is
always the case where such rocks are found, the country is hilly and
rugged. On the western shores a <i>secondary</i> formation exists. This is
<i>stratified limestone</i>&mdash;the same as that which forms the bed of many of
the great prairies of America; and, indeed, the Lake Winnipeg lies
between this secondary formation and the primitive, which bounds it
on the east. Along its western shores extends the flat limestone
country, partly wooded and partly prairie land, running from that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
point for hundreds of miles up to the very foot of the Rocky Mountains,
where the primitive rocks again make their appearance in the
rugged peaks of that stupendous chain.</p>

<p>Lake Winnipeg is nearly three hundred miles in length, but it is
very narrow&mdash;being in its widest reach not over fifty miles, and in
many places only fifteen miles from shore to shore. It trends nearly
due north and south, leaning a little north-west and south-east, and
receives many large rivers, as the Red, the Saskatchewan, and the
Winnipeg. The waters of these are again carried out of it by other
rivers that run from the lake, and empty into the Hudson's Bay.
There is a belief among the hunters and voyageurs that this lake has
its tides like the ocean. Such, however, is not the case. There is at
times a rise and overflow of its waters, but it is not periodical, and is
supposed to be occasioned by strong winds forcing the waters towards
a particular shore.</p>

<p>Lake Winnipeg is remarkable, as being in the very centre of the
North American continent, and may be called the centre of the <i>canoe
navigation</i>. From this point it is possible to travel <i>by water</i> to Hudson's
Bay on the north-east, to the Atlantic Ocean on the east, to the
Gulf of Mexico on the south, to the Pacific on the west, and to the
Polar Sea on the north and north-west. Considering that some of
these distances are upwards of three thousand miles, it will be perceived
that Lake Winnipeg holds a singular position upon the continent.
All the routes mentioned can be made without any great
&ldquo;portage,&rdquo; and even a choice of route is often to be had upon those
different lines of communication.</p>

<p>These were points of information communicated by Norman as the
canoe was paddled along the shore; for Norman, although troubling
himself but little about the causes of things, possessed a good practical
knowledge of things as they actually were. He was tolerably
well acquainted with the routes, their portages, and distances.
Some of them he had travelled over in company with his father,
and of others he had heard the accounts given by the voyageurs,
traders, and trappers. Norman knew that Lake Winnipeg was
muddy&mdash;he did not care to inquire the cause. He knew that there
was a hilly country on its eastern and a low level land on its
western shores, but it never occurred to him to speculate on this geological
difference.</p>

<p>It was the naturalist, Lucien, who threw out some hints on this
part of the subject, and further added his opinion, that the lake came
to be there in consequence of the wearing away of the rocks at the
junction of the stratified with the primitive formation, thus creating
an excavation in the surface, which in time became filled with
water and formed the lake. This cause he also assigned for the existence
of a remarkable &ldquo;chain of lakes&rdquo; that extends almost from the
Arctic Sea to the frontiers of Canada. The most noted of these are
Martin, Great Slave, Athabasca, Wollaston, Deer, Lake Winnipeg and
the Lake of the Woods.</p>

<p>Lucien further informed his companions, that where primitive
rocks form the surface of a country, that surface will be found to
exhibit great diversity of aspect. There will be numerous lakes and
swamps, rugged steep hills with deep valleys between, short streams
with many falls and rapids. These are the characteristics of a primitive
surface. On the other hand, where secondary rocks prevail the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
surface is usually a series of plains, often high, dry, and treeless, as is
the case upon the great American prairies.</p>

<p>Upon such topics did Lucien instruct his companions, as they
paddled their canoe around the edge of the lake. They had turned
the head of their little vessel westward&mdash;as it was their design to
keep along the western border of the lake until they should reach the
mouth of the Saskatchewan. They kept at a short distance from the
shore, usually steering from point to point, and in this way making
their route as direct as possible. It would have been still more direct
had they struck out into the open lake, and kept up its middle; but
this would have been a dangerous course to pursue.</p>

<p>There are often high winds upon Lake Winnipeg, that spring up
suddenly; and at such times the waves, if not mountains high, at
least arrive at the height of houses. Among such billows the little craft
would have been in danger of being swamped, and our voyageurs of
going to the bottom. They, therefore, wisely resolved not to risk such
an accident, but to &ldquo;hug the shore,&rdquo; though it made their voyage longer.
Each night they would land at some convenient place, kindle their
fire, cook their supper, and dry their canoe for the next day's journey.</p>

<p>According to this arrangement, a little before sunset of the first
day they came to land and made their camp. The canoe was unloaded,
carefully lifted out of the water, and then set bottom upward to drip
and dry. A fire was kindled, some of the dry meat cooked, and all
four sat down and began to eat, as only hungry travellers can.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class="cap">WAPITI, WOLVES, AND WOLVERENE</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he spot where our voyageurs had landed was at the bottom of a
small bay. The country back from the lake was level and clear of
timber. Here and there, nearer the shore, however, its surface was
prettily interspersed with small clumps of willows, that formed little
copse-like thickets of deep green. Beside one of these thickets,
within a hundred yards of the beach, the fire had been kindled, on a
spot of ground that commanded a view of the plain for miles back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo; cried Fran&ccedil;ois, who had finished eating, and risen
to his feet. &ldquo;What are these, captain?&rdquo; Fran&ccedil;ois pointed to some
objects that appeared at a great distance off upon the plain.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;captain&rdquo; rose up, placed his hand so as to shade his eyes from
the sun, and, after looking for a second or two in the direction indicated,
replied to the other's question by simply saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wapiti.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm no wiser than before I asked the question,&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois.
&ldquo;Pray, enlighten me as to what a wapiti may be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, red deer; or elk, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! elk&mdash;now I understand you. I thought they were elk, but
they're so far off I wasn't sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucien at this moment rose up, and looking through a small telescope,
which he carried, confirmed the statement of the &ldquo;captain,&rdquo;
and pronounced it to be a herd of elk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Luce,&rdquo; demanded Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;tell us what you know of the
elk. It will pass the time. Norman says it's no use going after them
out there in the open ground, as they'd shy off before one could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
get within shot. You see there is not a bush within half-a-mile of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we wait,&rdquo; interrupted Norman, &ldquo;I should not wonder but we
may have them among the bushes before long. They appear to be
grazing this way. I warrant you, they'll come to the lake to drink
before nightfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well then: the philosopher can tell us all about them before
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucien, thus appealed to, began:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are few animals that have so many names as this. It is
called in different districts, or by different authors, <i>elk</i>, <i>round-horned
elk</i>, <i>American elk</i>, <i>stag</i>, <i>red deer</i>, <i>grey moose</i>, <i>le biche</i>, <i>wapiti</i> and
<i>wewaskish</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may ask, Why so many names? I shall tell you. It is called
'elk' because it was supposed by the early colonists to be the same as
the elk of Europe. Its name of 'grey moose' is a hunter appellation,
to distinguish it from the real moose, which the same hunters know
as the 'black moose.' 'Round-horned elk' is also a hunter name.
'Wewaskish,' or 'waskesse,' is an Indian name for the animal. 'Stag'
comes from the European deer so called, because this species somewhat
resembles the stag; and 'red deer' is a name used by the Hudson
Bay traders. 'Le biche' is another synonyme of French authors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all these names I think that of 'wapiti,' which our cousin has
given, the best. The names of 'elk,' 'stag,' and 'red deer,' lead to
confusion, as there are other species to which they properly belong,
all of which are entirely different from the wapiti. I believe that
this last name is now used by the best-informed naturalists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; continued Lucien, &ldquo;the wapiti is the noblest of
all the deer kind. It possesses the fine form of the European stag,
while it is nearly a third larger and stronger. It has all the grace of
limb and motion that belongs to the common deer, while its towering
horns give it a most majestic and imposing appearance. Its colour
during the summer is of a reddish brown, hence the name red deer;
but, indeed, the reddish tint upon the wapiti is deeper and richer
than that of its European cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wapiti, like other deer, brings forth its fawns in the spring.
They are usually a male and female, for two is the number it produces.
The males only have horns; and they must be several years old before
the antlers become full and branching. They fall every year, but not
until February or March, and then the new ones grow out in a
month or six weeks. During the summer the horns remain soft and
tender to the touch. They are covered at this time with a soft membrane,
that looks like greyish velvet, and they are then said to be 'in
the velvet.' There are nerves and blood-vessels running through this
membrane, and a blow upon the horns at this season gives great pain
to the animal. When the autumn arrives the velvet peels off, and
they become as hard as bone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would need to be, for this is the 'rutting' season, and the
bucks fight furious battles with each other, clashing their horns
together, as if they would break them to pieces. Very often a pair
of bucks, while thus contending, 'lock' their antlers, and being unable
to draw them apart, remain head to head, until both die with hunger,
or fall a prey to the prowling wolves. This is true not only of the
elk, but also of the reindeer, the moose, and many other species of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
deer. Hundreds of pairs of horns have been found thus 'locked,'
and the solitary hunter has often surprised the deer in this unpleasant
predicament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wapiti utters a whistling sound, that can be heard far off, and
often guides the hunter to the right spot. In the rutting season the
bucks make other noises, which somewhat resemble the braying of an
ass, and are equally disagreeable to listen to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wapiti travel about in small herds, rarely exceeding fifty, but
often of only six or seven. Where they are not much hunted they are
easily approached, but otherwise they are shy enough. The bucks,
when wounded and brought to bay, become dangerous assailants;
much more so than those of the common deer. Hunters have sometimes
escaped with difficulty from their horns and hoofs, with the
latter of which they can inflict very severe blows. They are hunted
in the same way as other deer; but the Indians capture many of them
in the water, when they discover them crossing lakes or rivers. They
are excellent swimmers, and can make their way over the arm of a
lake or across the widest river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They feed upon grass, and sometimes on the young shoots of willows
and poplar trees. They are especially fond of a species of wild rose
which grows in the countries they frequent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wapiti at one time ranged over a large part of the continent of
North America. Its range is now restricted by the spread of the
settlements. It is still found in most of the Northern parts of the
United States, but only in remote mountainous districts and even
there it is a rare animal. In Canada it is more common; and it roams
across the continent to the shores of the Pacific. It it not an animal
of the tropical countries, as it is not found in Mexico proper. On the
other hand, wapiti do not go farther north than about the fifty-seventh
parallel of latitude, and then they are not in their favourite
habitat, which is properly the temperate zone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucien was interrupted by an exclamation from Basil, who stood up
looking out upon the prairie. They all saw that he had been observing
the wapiti.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried they.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look yonder!&rdquo; replied Basil, pointing in the direction of the herd.
&ldquo;Something disturbs them. Give me your glass, Luce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucien handed the telescope to his brother, who, drawing it to the
proper focus, pointed it towards the deer. The rest watched them,
with the naked eye. They could see that there was some trouble
among the animals. There were only six in the herd, and even at the
distance our voyageurs could tell that they were all bucks, for it was
the season when the does secrete themselves in the woods and thickets
to bring forth their young. They were running to and fro upon the
prairie, and doubling about as if playing, or rather as if some creature
was chasing them. With the naked eye, however, nothing could be
seen upon the ground but the bucks themselves, and all the others
looked to Basil, who held the glass, for an explanation of their odd
man&#339;uvres.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are wolves at them,&rdquo; said Basil, after regarding them for a
second or two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's odd,&rdquo; rejoined Norman. &ldquo;Wolves don't often attack full-grown
wapiti, except when wounded or crippled somehow. They
must be precious hungry. What sort of wolves are they?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>To you, boy reader, this question may seem strange. You, perhaps,
think that a wolf is a wolf, and there is but one kind. Such, however,
is not the exact truth. In America there are two distinct species or
wolves, and of these two species there are many varieties, which differ
so much in colour and other respects, that some authors have classed
them as so many distinct species instead of considering them mere
varieties. Whether they may be species or not is still a question
among naturalists; but certain it is that <i>two</i> well-defined species do
exist, which differ in size, form, colour, and habits.</p>

<p>These are the <i>large</i> or <i>common wolf</i>, and the barking or prairie wolf.
The first species is the American representative of the common wolf
of Europe; and although an animal of similar nature and habits, it
differs very much from the latter in form and appearance. It is, therefore,
not the <i>same</i>, as hitherto supposed. This American wolf is found
in greater or less numbers throughout the whole continent; but in
the Northern regions it is very common, and is seen in at least five
different varieties, known by the characteristic names of <i>black</i>, <i>pied</i>,
<i>white</i>, <i>dusky</i>, and <i>grey</i> wolves. Of these the grey is the most numerous
kind; but as I shall have occasion to speak of the large wolves hearafter,
I shall say no more of them at present, but direct your attention
to the second and very different species, the <i>prairie wolves</i>.</p>

<p>These are a full third smaller than the common kind. They are
swifter, and go in larger packs. They bring forth their young in
burrows on the open plain, and not among the woods, like the other
species. They are the most cunning of American animals, not excepting
their kindred the foxes. They cannot be trapped by any contrivance,
but by singular man&#339;uvres often themselves decoy the over-curious
antelope to approach too near them. When a gun is fired
upon the prairies they may be seen starting up on all sides, and
running for the spot in hopes of coming in for a share of the game.
Should an animal&mdash;deer, antelope, or buffalo&mdash;be wounded, and escape
the hunter, it is not likely to escape them also. They will set after it,
and run it down if <i>the wound has been a mortal one</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the wound has been only slight, and is not
likely in the end to cripple the animal, the wolves will not stir from&mdash;the
spot. This extraordinary sagacity often tells the hunter whether
it is worth his while to follow the game he has shot at; but in any
case he is likely to arrive late, if the wolves set out before him, as a
dozen of them will devour the largest deer in a few minutes' time.
The prairie wolves as well as the others follow the herds of buffaloes,
and attack the gravid cows and calves when separated from the rest.
Frequently they sustain a contest with the bulls, when the latter are
old or wounded, but on such occasions many of them get killed before
the old bull becomes their prey.</p>

<p>They resemble the common grey wolf in colour, but there are
varieties in this respect, though not so great as among the larger
species. Their voice is entirely different, and consists of three
distinct barks, ending in a prolonged howl. Hence the specific and
usual name &ldquo;barking wolf.&rdquo; They are found only in the Western or
prairie half of the continent, and thence west to the Pacific. Their
Northern range is limited to the fifty-fifth parallel of latitude&mdash;but
they are met with southward throughout Mexico, where they are
common enough, and known by the name of &ldquo;coyot&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their skins are an article of trade with the Hudson's Bay Company.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
The fur is of about the same quality with that of other wolves, and
consists of long hairs, with a thick wool at the base. In commerce
they are termed &ldquo;cased wolves,&rdquo; because their skins, on being removed,
are not split open as with the large wolf-skins, but are stript
off after the manner of rabbits, and then turned inside out, or &ldquo;cased,&rdquo;
as it is termed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prairie wolves!&rdquo; said Basil, in answer to the question put by his
cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be something the matter with one of the bucks, then,&rdquo;
remarked Norman, &ldquo;or else there's a good big pack of the wolves, and
they expect to tire one down. I believe they sometimes do try it that
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There appears to be a large pack,&rdquo; answered Basil, still looking
through the glass; &ldquo;fifty at least&mdash;See! they have separated one of
the bucks from the herd&mdash;it's running this way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Basil's companions had noticed this as soon as himself, and all four
now leaped to their guns. The wapiti was plainly coming towards
them, and they could now distinguish the wolves following upon his
heels, strung out over the prairie like a pack of hounds. When first
started, the buck was a full half-mile distant, but in less than a
minute's time he came breasting forward until the boys could see his
sparkling eyes and the play of his proud flanks. He was a noble
animal to look at. His horns were full grown, but still &ldquo;in the velvet,&rdquo;
and as he ran with his snout thrown forward, his antlers lay along
both sides of his neck until their tips touched his shoulders.</p>

<p>He continued on in a direct line until he was within less than an
hundred paces of the camp; but, perceiving the smoke of the fire, and
the figures crouching around it, he swerved suddenly from his course,
and darted into the thicket of willows, where he was for the moment
hidden from view. The wolves&mdash;fifty of them at least&mdash;had followed
him up to this point; and as he entered the thicket several had been
close upon his heels. The boys expected to see the wolves rush in
after him&mdash;as there appeared to be no impediment to their doing so&mdash;but,
to the astonishment of all, the latter came to a sudden halt, and
then went sneaking back&mdash;some of them even running off as if terrified!</p>

<p>At first the hunters attributed this strange conduct to their own
presence, and the smoke of the camp; but a moment's reflection convinced
them that this could not be the reason of it, as they were all
well acquainted with the nature of the prairie wolf, and had never
witnessed a similar exhibition before.</p>

<p>They had no time to think of the wolves just then. The buck was
the main attraction, and, calling to each other to surround the
thicket, all four started in different directions. In a couple of
minutes they had placed themselves at nearly equal distances around
the copse, and stood watching eagerly for the reappearance of the
wapiti.</p>

<p>The willows covered about an acre of ground, but they were
tolerably think and full-leaved, and the buck could not be seen from
any side. Wherever he was, he was evidently at a stand-still, for not
a rustle could be heard among the leaves, nor were any of the tall
stalks seen to move.</p>

<p>Marengo was now sent in. This would soon start him, and all four
stood with guns cocked and ready. But before the dog had made
three lengths of himself into the thicket, a loud snort was heard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
followed by a struggle and the stamping of hoofs, and the next
moment the wapiti came crashing through the bushes. A shot was
fired&mdash;it was the crack of Lucien's small rifle&mdash;but it had missed, for
the buck was seen passing onward and outward. All ran round to
the side he had taken, and had a full view of the animal as he
bounded off. Instead of running free as before, he now leaped
heavily forward, and what was their astonishment on seeing that he
<i>carried another animal upon his back</i>!</p>

<span class="caption">THE WAPITI AND THE WOLVERENE.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>The hunters could hardly believe their eyes, but there it was, sure
enough, a brown shaggy mass, lying flat along the shoulders of the
wapiti, and clutching it with large spreading claws. Fran&ccedil;ois cried
out, &ldquo;A panther!&rdquo; and Basil at first believed it to be a bear, but it
was hardly large enough for that. Norman, however, who had lived
more in those parts where the animal is found, knew it at once to be
the dreaded &ldquo;wolverene.&rdquo; Its head could not be seen, as that was
hid behind the shoulder of the wapiti, whose throat it was engaged
in tearing. But its short legs and broad paws, its bushy tail and
long shaggy hair, together with its round-arching back and dark-brown
colour, were all familiar marks to the young fur-trader; and
he at once pronounced it a &ldquo;wolverene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When first seen, both it and the wapiti were beyond the reach of
their rifles; and the hunters, surprised by such an unexpected
apparition, had suddenly halted. Fran&ccedil;ois and Basil were about to
renew the pursuit, but were prevented by Norman, who counselled
them to remain where they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won't go far,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;let us watch them a bit. See! the
buck takes the water!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wapiti, on leaving the willows, had run straight out in the
first direction that offered, which happened to be in a line parallel
with the edge of the lake. His eye, however, soon caught sight of
the water, and, doubling suddenly round, he made directly towards
it, evidently with the intention of plunging in. He had hopes, no
doubt, that by this means he might rid himself of the terrible
creature that was clinging to his shoulders, and tearing his throat to
pieces.</p>

<p>A few bounds brought him to the shore. There was no beach at
the spot. The bank&mdash;a limestone bluff&mdash;rose steeply from the water's
edge to a height of eight feet, and the lake under it was several
fathoms in depth. The buck did not hesitate, but sprang outward
and downwards. A heavy plash followed, and for some seconds
both wapiti and wolverene were lost under the water. They rose to
the surface, just as the boys reached the bank, but they came up
<i>separately</i>. The dip had proved a cooler to the fierce wolverene; and
while the wapiti was seen to strike boldly out into the lake and
swim off, the latter&mdash;evidently out of his element&mdash;kept plunging
about clumsily, and struggling to get back to the shore.</p>

<p>Their position upon the cliff above gave the hunters an excellent
opportunity with their rifles, and both Basil and Norman sent their
bullets into the wolverene's back. Fran&ccedil;ois also emptied his double-barrelled
gun at the same object, and the shaggy brute sank dead to
the bottom of the lake. Strange to say, not one of the party had
thought of firing at the buck. This persecution by so many enemies
had won for him their sympathy, and they would now have suffered
him to go free, but the prospect of fresh venison for supper overcame
their commiseration, and the moment the wolverene was despatched
all set about securing the deer.</p>

<p>Their guns were reloaded, and, scattering along the shore, they
prepared to await his return. But the buck, seeing there was nothing
but death in his rear, swam on, keeping almost in a direct line out
into the lake. It was evident to all that he could not swim across
the lake, as its farther shore was not even visible. He must either
return to where they were, or drown; and knowing this to be his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
only alternative, they stood still and watched his motions. When he
had got about half-a-mile from the shore, to the surprise of all, he
was seen to rise higher and higher above the surface, and then all at
once stop, with half of his body clear out of the water! He had come
upon a shoal, and, knowing the advantage of it, seemed determined
to remain there.</p>

<p>Basil and Norman ran to the canoe, and in a few minutes the little
craft was launched, and shooting through the water. The buck now
saw that it was likely to be all up with him, and, instead of attempting
to swim farther, he faced round, and set his antlers forward in a
threatening attitude. But his pursuers did not give him the chance
to make a rush. When within fifty yards or so, Norman, who used
the paddles, stopped and steadied the canoe, and the next moment
the crack of Basil's rifle echoed over the lake, and the wapiti fell upon
the water, where, after struggling a moment, he lay dead.</p>

<p>The canoe was paddled up, and his antlers being made fast to the
stern, he was towed back to the shore, and carried into camp. What
now surprised our voyageurs was, their finding that the wapiti had
been wounded before encountering either the wolves, wolverene, or
themselves. An arrow-head, with a short piece of the shaft, was
sticking in one of his thighs. The Indians, then, had been after him,
and very lately too, as the wound showed. It was not a mortal
wound, had the arrow-head been removed; but of course, as it was,
it would have proved his death in the long run. This explained why
the wolves had assailed an animal, that otherwise, from his great
size and strength, would have defied them.</p>

<p>The wolverene, moreover, rarely attacks game so large as the
wapiti; but the latter had, no doubt, chanced upon the lair of his
fierce enemy, who could not resist such a tempting opportunity of
getting a meal. The wolves had seen the wolverene as they approached
the thicket, and that accounted for their strange behaviour
in the pursuit. These creatures are as great cowards as they are
tyrants, and their dread of a wolverene is equal to that with which
they themselves often inspire the wounded deer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class="cap">A PAIR OF DEEP DIVERS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he wapiti was carefully skinned, and the skin spread out to dry.
Since their mishap our voyageurs had been very short of clothing.
The three skins of the woodland caribou had made only a pair of
jackets, instead of full hunting-shirts, and even these were pinched
fits. For beds and bed-clothes they had nothing but the hides of
buffaloes, and these, although good as far as they went, were only
enough for two. Lucien, the most delicate of the party, appropriated
one, as the others insisted upon his so doing. Fran&ccedil;ois had the other.</p>

<p>As for Basil and Norman, they were forced each night to lie upon
the naked earth, and but for the large fires which they kept blazing
all the night, they would have suffered severely from cold. Indeed,
they did suffer quite enough; for some of the nights were so cold,
that it was impossible to sleep by the largest fire without one-half of
their bodies feeling chilled. The usual practice with travellers in the
West is to lie with their feet to the fire, while the head is at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
greatest distance from it. This is considered the best mode, for so
long as the feet are warm, the rest of the body will not suffer badly;
but, on the contrary, if the feet are allowed to get cold, no matter
what state the other parts be in, it is impossible to sleep with comfort.</p>

<p>Of course our young voyageurs followed the well-known practice
of the country, and lay with their feet to the fire in such a manner
that, when all were placed, their bodies formed four radii of a circle,
of which the fire was the centre. Marengo usually lay beside Basil,
whom he looked upon as his proper master.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a bed of grass and leaves which they each night
spread for themselves, they were sadly in want of blankets, and
therefore the skin of the wapiti, which was a very fine one, would be
a welcome addition to their stock of bedding. They resolved, therefore,
to remain one day where they had killed it, so that the skin
might be dried and receive a partial dressing. Moreover, they
intended to &ldquo;jerk&rdquo; some of the meat&mdash;although elk-venison is not
considered very palatable where other meat can be had. It is without
juice, and resembles dry short-grained beef more than venison. For
this reason it is looked upon by both Indians and white hunters as
inferior to buffalo, moose, caribou, or even the common deer. One
peculiarity of the flesh of this animal is, that the fat becomes hard
the moment it is taken off the fire. It freezes upon the lips like suet,
and clings around the teeth of a person eating it, which is not the
case with that of other species of deer.</p>

<p>The skin of the wapiti, however, is held in high esteem among the
Indians. It is thinner than that of the moose, but makes a much
better article of leather. When dressed in the Indian fashion&mdash;that
is to say, soaked in a lather composed of the brains and fat of the
animal itself, and then washed, dried, scraped, and smoked&mdash;it
becomes as soft and pliable as a kid-glove, and will wash and dry
without stiffening like chamois leather. That is a great advantage
which it has, in the eyes of the Indians, over the skins of other species
of deer, as the moose and caribou&mdash;for the leather made from these,
after a wetting, becomes harsh and rigid and requires a great deal of
rubbing to render it soft again.</p>

<p>Lucien knew how to dress the elk-hide, and could make leather out
of it as well as any Indian squaw in the country. But travelling as
they were, there was not a good opportunity for that; so they were
content to give it such a dressing as the circumstances might allow.
It was spread out on a frame of willow-poles, and set up in front of
the fire, to be scraped at intervals and cleared of the fatty matter, as
well as the numerous parasites that at this season adhere to the
skins of the wapiti.</p>

<p>While Lucien was framing the skin, Basil and Norman occupied
themselves in cutting the choice pieces of the meat into thin slices
and hanging them up before the fire. This job being finished, all sat
down to watch Lucien currying his hide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, boys!&rdquo; cried Fran&ccedil;ois, starting up as if something had
occurred to him; &ldquo;what about the wolverene? It's a splendid skin&mdash;why
not get it too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; replied Norman, &ldquo;we had forgotten that. But
the beast's gone to the bottom&mdash;how can we get at him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, fish him up, to be sure,&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois. &ldquo;Let's splice one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
of these willow-poles to my ram rod, and I'll screw it into him, and
draw him to the surface in a jiffy. Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must get the canoe round, then,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;The bank's
too steep for us to reach him without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; assented Fran&ccedil;ois, at the same time going towards
the willows; &ldquo;get you the canoe into the water, while I cut the
sapling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; cried Basil, &ldquo;I'll show you a shorter method. Marengo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Basil said this, he rose to his feet, and walked down to the bluff
where they had shot the wolverene. All of them followed him as
well as Marengo, who bounded triumphantly from side to side,
knowing he was wanted for some important enterprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you expect the dog to fetch him out?&rdquo; inquired Norman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Basil; &ldquo;only to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment&mdash;you shall see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Basil flung down his 'coon-skin cap, and stripped off his caribou
jacket, then his striped cotton shirt, then his under-shirt of fawn
skin, and, lastly, his trousers, leggings, and mocassins. He was now
as naked as Adam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll show you, cousin,&rdquo; said he, addressing himself to Norman,
&ldquo;how we take the water down there on the Mississippi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he stepped forward to the edge of the bluff; and having
carefully noted the spot where the wolverene had gone down, turned
to the dog, and simply said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! Marengo! <i>Chez moi</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dog answered with a whimper, and a look of intelligence
which showed that he understood his master's wish.</p>

<p>Basil again pointed to the lake, raised his arms over his head,
placing his palms close together, launched himself out into the air,
and shot down head-foremost into the water.</p>

<p>Marengo, uttering a loud bay, sprang after so quickly that the
plunges were almost simultaneous, and both master and dog were
for some time hidden from view. The latter rose first, but it was
a long time before Basil came to the surface&mdash;so long that Norman
and the others were beginning to feel uneasy, and to regard the
water with some anxiety. At length, however, a spot was seen to
bubble, several yards from where he had gone down, and the black
head of Basil appeared above the surface. It was seen that he held
something in his teeth, and was pushing a heavy body before him,
which they saw was the wolverene.</p>

<p>Marengo, who swam near, now seized hold of the object, and
pulled it away from his master, who, calling to the dog to follow,
struck out towards a point where the bank was low and shelving.
In a few minutes Basil reached a landing-place, and shortly after
Marengo arrived towing the wolverene, which was speedily pulled
out upon the bank, and carried, or rather dragged, by Norman and
Fran&ccedil;ois to the camp. Lucien brought Basil's clothes, and all four
once more assembled around the blazing fire.</p>

<p>There is not a more hideous-looking animal in America than the
wolverene. His thick body and short stout legs, his shaggy coat and
bushy tail, but, above all, his long curving claws and dog-like jaws,
gave him a formidable appearance. His gait is low and skulking,
and his look bold and vicious. He walks somewhat like a bear, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
his tracks are often mistaken for those of that animal. Indians and
hunters, however, know the difference well. His hind feet are
plantigrade, that is, they rest upon the ground from heel to toe; and
his back curves like the segment of a circle. He is fierce and extremely
voracious&mdash;quite as much so as the &ldquo;glutton,&rdquo; of which he is
the American representative.</p>

<p>No animal is more destructive to the small game, and he will also
attack and devour the larger kinds when he can get hold of them;
but as he is somewhat slow, he can only seize most of them by
stratagem. It is a common belief that he lies in wait upon trees and
rocks to seize the deer passing beneath. It has been also asserted
that he places moss, such as these animals feed upon under his perch,
in order to entice them within reach; and it has been still further
asserted, that the arctic foxes assist him in his plans, by hunting the
deer towards the spot where he lies in wait, thus acting as his jackals.</p>

<p>These assertions have been made more particularly about his
European cousin, the &ldquo;glutton,&rdquo; about whom other stories are told
equally strange&mdash;one of them, that he eats until scarce able to walk,
and then draws his body through a narrow space between two trees,
in order to relieve himself and get ready for a fresh meal. Buffon
and others have given credence to these tales upon the authority of
one &ldquo;Olaus Magnus,&rdquo; whose name, from the circumstance, might
be translated &ldquo;great fibber.&rdquo; There is no doubt, however, that the
glutton is one of the most sagacious of animals, and so, too, is the
wolverene. The latter gives proof of this by many of his habits;
one in particular fully illustrates his cunning. It is this.</p>

<p>The marten trappers of the Hudson Bay territory set their traps
in the snow, often extending over a line of fifty miles. These traps
are constructed out of pieces of wood found near the spot, and are
baited with the heads of partridges, or pieces of venison, of which
the marten is very fond. As soon as the marten seizes the bait, a
trigger is touched, and a heavy piece of wood falling upon the
animal, crushes or holds it fast. Now the wolverene <i>enters the trap
from behind</i>, tears the back out of it before touching the bait, and
thus avoids the falling log! Moreover, he will follow the tracks of
the trapper from one to another, until he has destroyed the whole
line.</p>

<p>Should a marten happen to have been before him, and got caught
in the trap, he rarely ever eats it, as he is not fond of its flesh. But
he is not satisfied to leave it as he finds it. He usually digs it from
under the log, tears it to pieces, and then buries it under the snow.
The foxes, who are well aware of this habit, and who themselves
greedily eat the marten, are frequently seen following him upon such
excursions. They are not strong enough to take the log from off the
trapped animal, but from their keen scent can soon find it where the
other has buried it in the snow. In this way, instead of their being
providers for the wolverene, the reverse is the true story. Notwithstanding,
the wolverene will eat <i>them</i> too, whenever he can get his
claws upon them; but as they are much swifter than he, this seldom
happens.</p>

<p>The foxes, however, are themselves taken in traps, or more commonly
shot by guns set for the purpose, with the bait attached by a
string to the trigger. Often the wolverene, finding the foxes dead or
wounded, makes a meal of them before the hunter comes along to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
examine his traps and guns. The wolverene kills many of the foxes
while young, and sometimes on finding their burrow, widens it with
his strong claws, and eats the whole family in their nests. Even
young wolves sometimes become his prey. He lives, in fact, on very
bad terms with both foxes and wolves, and often robs the latter of
a fat deer which they may have just killed, and are preparing to
dine upon. The beaver, however, is his favourite food, and but that
these creatures can escape him by taking to the water&mdash;in which
element he is not at all at home&mdash;he would soon exterminate their
whole race. His great strength and acute scent enable him to overcome
almost every wild creature of the forest or prairie. He is even
said to be a full match for either the panther or the black bear.</p>

<p>The wolverene lives in clefts of rock, or in hollow trees, where such
are to be found; but he is equally an inhabitant of the forest and the
prairie. He is found in fertile districts, as well as in the most remote
deserts. His range is extensive, but he is properly a denizen of the
cold and snowy regions. In the southern parts of the United States
he is no longer known, though it is certain that he once lived there
when those countries were inhabited by the beaver. North of latitude
40&deg; he ranges perhaps to the pole itself, as traces of him have been
found as far as man has yet penetrated.</p>

<p>He is a solitary creature, and, like most predatory animals, a
nocturnal prowler. The female brings forth two, sometimes three
and four, at a birth. The cubs are of a cream colour, and only when
full grown acquire that dark brown hue, which in the extreme of
winter often passes into black. The fur is not unlike that of the bear
but is shorter-haired, and of less value than a bear-skin. Notwithstanding,
it is an article of trade with the Hudson's Bay Company,
who procure many thousands of the skins annually.</p>

<p>The Canadian voyageurs call the wolverene &ldquo;carcajou;&rdquo; while
among the Orkney and Scotch servants of the Hudson's Bay Company
he is oftener known as the &ldquo;quickhatch.&rdquo; It is supposed that both,
these names are corruptions of the Cree word <i>okee-coo-haw-gew</i> (the
name of the wolverene among the Indians of that tribe). Many
words from the same language have been adopted by both voyageurs
and traders.</p>

<p>Those points in the natural history of the wolverene, that might be
called <i>scientific</i>, were imparted by Lucien, while Norman furnished
the information about its habits. Norman knew the animal as one
of the most common in the &ldquo;trade&rdquo;; and in addition to what we have
recorded, also related many adventures and stories current among the
voyageurs, in which this creature figures in quite as fanciful a manner
as he does in the works either of Olaus Magnus, or Count de Buffon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class="cap">A GRAND SUNDAY DINNER.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span>fter remaining a day at their first camp on the lake, our voyageurs
continued their journey. Their course lay a little to the west of
north, as the edge of the lake trended in that direction. Their usual
plan, as already stated, was to keep out in the lake far enough to
shun the numerous indentations of the shore, yet not so far as to
endanger their little craft when the wind was high. At night they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
always landed, either upon some point or on an island. Sometimes
the wind blew &ldquo;dead ahead,&rdquo; and then their day's journey would be
only a few miles. When the wind was favourable they made good
progress, using the skin of the wapiti for a sail. On one of these
days they reckoned a distance of over forty miles from camp to
camp.</p>

<p>It was their custom always to lie by on Sunday, for our young
voyageurs were Christians. They had done so on their former
expedition across the Southern prairies, and they had found the
practice to their advantage in a physical as well as a moral sense.
They required the rest thus obtained; besides, a general cleaning up
is necessary, at least, once every week. Sunday was also a day of
feasting with them. They had more time to devote to culinary
operations, and the <i>cuisine</i> of that day was always the most varied of
the week. Any extra delicacy obtained by the rifle on previous days,
was usually reserved for the Sunday's dinner.</p>

<p>On the first Sunday after entering Lake Winnipeg the &ldquo;camp&rdquo;
chanced to be upon an island. It was a small island, of only a few
acres in extent. It lay near the shore, and was well wooded over its
whole surface with trees of many different kinds. Indeed, islands in
a large lake usually have a great variety of trees, as the seeds of all
those sorts that grow around the shores are carried thither by the
waves, or in the crops of the numerous birds that flit over its waters.
But as the island in question lay in a lake, whose shores exhibited
such a varied geology, it was natural the vegetation of the island
itself should be varied. And, in truth, it was so.</p>

<p>Among the low bushes and shrubs there were rose and wild raspberry;
there were apple and plum trees, and whole thickets of the
&ldquo;Pembina.&rdquo; There is, in fact, no part of the world where a greater
variety of wild fruit has been found indigenous than upon the banks
of the Red River of the North, and this variety extended to the little
island where our voyageurs had encamped.</p>

<p>The camp had been placed under a beautiful tree&mdash;the tacamahac,
or balsam poplar. This is one of the finest trees of America, and one
of those that extend farthest north into the cold countries. In
favourable situations it attains a height of one hundred and fifty feet,
with a proportionate thickness of trunk; but it is oftener only fifty
or eighty feet high. Its leaves are oval, and, when young, of a rich
yellowish colour, which changes to a bright green. The buds are
very large, yellow, and covered with a varnish, which exhales a
delightful fragrance, and gives to the tree its specific name.</p>

<p>It was near sunset on the afternoon of Saturday, the travellers had
just finished their repast, and were reclining around a fire of red
cedar, whose delicate smoke curled up among the pale green leaves of
the poplars. The fragrant smell of the burning wood, mixed with the
aromatic odour of the balsam-tree, filled the air with a sweet perfume,
and, almost without knowing why, our voyageurs felt a sense
of pleasure stealing over them. The woods of the little island were
not without their voices.</p>

<p>The scream of the jay was heard, and his bright azure wing
appeared now and then among the foliage. The scarlet plumage of
the cardinal grosbeak flashed under the beams of the setting sun;
and the trumpet-note of the ivory-billed woodpecker was heard near
the centre of the island. An osprey was circling in the air, with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
eye bent on the water below, watching for his finny prey; and a pair
of bald eagles were winging their way towards the adjacent mainland.
Half-a-dozen turkey vultures were wheeling above the beach, where
some object, fish or carrion, had been thrown up by the waves.</p>

<p>For some time the party remained silent, each contemplating the
scene with feelings of pleasure. Fran&ccedil;ois, as usual, first broke the
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, cook, what's for dinner to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was to Lucien this speech was addressed. He was regarded as
the <i>maitre de cuisine</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roast or boiled&mdash;which would you prefer?&rdquo; asked the cook, with
a significant smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Fran&ccedil;ois; &ldquo;boiled, indeed! a pretty boil
we could have in a tin cup, holding less than a pint. I wish we <i>could</i>
have a boiled joint and a bowl of soup. I'd give something for it.
I'm precious tired of this everlasting dry roast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have both,&rdquo; rejoined Lucien, &ldquo;for to-morrow's dinner.
I promise you both the soup and the joint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Fran&ccedil;ois laughed increduously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to make soup in your shoe, Luce?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but I shall make it in this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Lucien held up a vessel somewhat like a water-pail, which the
day before he had himself made out of birch-bark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;I know you have got a vessel that holds
water, but cold water ain't soup; and if you can boil water in that
vessel, I'll believe you to be a conjuror. I know you can do some
curious things with your chemical mixtures; but that you can't do,
I'm sure. Why, man, the bottom would be burned out of your
bucket before the water got blood-warm. Soup, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Frank, you shall see. You're only like the rest of
mankind&mdash;incredulous about everything they can't comprehend. If
you'll take your hook and line, and catch some fish, I promise to give
you a dinner to-morrow, with all the regular courses&mdash;soup, fish,
boiled, roast, and dessert, too! I'm satisfied I can do all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Parbleu</i>! brother, you should have been cook to Lucullus. Well,
I'll catch the fish for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Fran&ccedil;ois took a fish-hook and line out of his pouch, and
fixing a large grasshopper upon the hook, stepped forward to the edge
of the water, and cast it in. The float was soon seen to bob and then
sink, and Fran&ccedil;ois jerked his hook ashore with a small and very
pretty fish upon it of a silver hue, with which the lake and the waters
running into it abound. Lucien told him it was a fish of the genus
<i>Hyodon</i>. He also advised him to bait with a worm, and let his bait
sink to the bottom, and he might catch a sturgeon, which would be a
larger fish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know there are sturgeon in the lake?&rdquo; inquired
Fran&ccedil;ois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am pretty sure of that,&rdquo; answered the naturalist; &ldquo;the sturgeon
is found all round the world in the northern temperate zone&mdash;both in
its seas and fresh waters; although, when you go farther south into
the warmer climate, no sturgeons exist. I am sure there are some
here, perhaps more than one species. Sink your bait for the sturgeon
is a toothless fish, and feeds upon soft substances at the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois followed the advice of his brother, and in a few minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
he had a &ldquo;nibble,&rdquo; and drew up and landed a very large fish, full
three feet in length. Lucien at once pronounced it a sturgeon, but of
a species he had not before seen. It was the <i>Acipenser carbonarius</i>, a
curious sort of fish found in these waters. It did not look like a fish
that would be pleasant eating; therefore Fran&ccedil;ois again took to bobbing
for the silver fish which, though small, he knew to be excellent
when broiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Basil, &ldquo;I must furnish my quota to this famous dinner
that is to be. Let me see what there is on the island in the way of
game;&rdquo; and shouldering his rifle, he walked off among the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;am not going to eat the produce of other
people's labour without contributing my share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the young trader took up his gun and went off in a different
direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien, &ldquo;we are likely to have plenty of meat
for the dinner. I must see about the vegetables;&rdquo; and taking with
him his new-made vessel, Lucien sauntered off along the shore of the
islet. Fran&ccedil;ois alone remained by the camp and continued his fishing.
Let us follow the plant-hunter, and learn a lesson of practical botany.</p>

<p>Lucien had not gone far, when he came to what appeared to be a
mere sedge growing in the water. The stalks or culms of this sedge were
full eight feet high, with smooth leaves, an inch broad, nearly a yard
in length, and of a light green colour. At the top of each stalk was
a large panicle of seeds, somewhat resembling a head of oats. The
plant itself was the famous wild rice so much prized by the Indians
as an article of food, and also the favourite of many wild birds
especially the reed-bird or rice-bunting. The grain of the zizania was
not yet ripe, but the ears were tolerably well filled, and Lucien saw
that it would do for his purpose. He therefore waded in, and stripped
off into his vessel as much as he wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am safe for rice-soup, at all events,&rdquo; soliloquised he, &ldquo;but I think
I can do still better;&rdquo; and he continued on around the shore, and
shortly after struck into some heavy timber that grew in a damp,
rich soil. He had walked about an hundred yards farther, when he
was seen to stoop and examine some object on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ought to be found here,&rdquo; he muttered to himself; &ldquo;this is the
very soil for it&mdash;yes, here we have it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The object over which he was stooping was a plant, but its leaves
appeared shrivelled, or rather quite withered away. The upper part
of a bulbous root, however, was just visible above the surface. It
was a bulb of the wild leek. The leaves, when young, are about six
inches in length, of a flat shape and often three inches broad; but,
strange to say, they shrivel or die off very early in the season&mdash;even
before the plant flowers, and then it is difficult to find the bulb.</p>

<p>Lucien, however, had sharp eyes for such things; and in a short
while he had rooted out several bulbs as large as pigeons' eggs, and
deposited them in his birchen vessel. He now turned to go back to
camp, satisfied with what he had obtained. He had the rice to give
consistency to his soup, and the leek roots to flavour it with. That
would be enough.</p>

<p>As he was walking over a piece of boggy ground his eye was
attracted to a singular plant, whose tall stem rose high above the
grass. It was full eight feet in height, and at its top there was an
umbel of conspicuous white flowers. Its leaves were large, lobed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
toothed, and the stem itself was over an inch in diameter, with
furrows running longitudinally. Lucien had never seen the plant
before, although he had often heard accounts of it, and he at once
recognised it from its botanical description. It was the celebrated
&ldquo;cow parsnip.&rdquo; Its stem was jointed and hollow, and Lucien had
heard that the Indians called it in their language &ldquo;flute stem,&rdquo; as
they often used it to make their rude musical instruments from, and
also a sort of whistle or &ldquo;call,&rdquo; by which they were enabled to imitate
and decoy several kinds of deer. But there was another use to which
the plant was put, of which the naturalist was not aware. Norman
who had been wandering about, came up at this moment, and seeing
Lucien standing by the plant, uttered a joyful &ldquo;Hulloh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; inquired Lucien, &ldquo;what pleases you, coz?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the flute-stem, of course. You talked of making a soup.
It will help you, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; demanded Lucien.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the young stems are good eating, and the roots, if you will;
but the young shoots are better. Both Indians and voyageurs eat
them in soup, and are fond of them. It's a famous thing, I assure
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us gather some, then,&rdquo; said Lucien; and the cousins commenced
cutting off such stems as were still young and tender. As
soon as they had obtained enough, they took their way back to the
camp. Basil had already arrived with a fine <i>prairie hen</i> which he had
shot, and Sandy had brought back a squirrel; so that, with Fran&ccedil;ois's
fish, of which a sufficient number had been caught, Lucien was likely
to be able to keep his promise about the dinner.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois, however, could not yet comprehend how the soup was to
be boiled in a wooden pot; and, indeed, Basil was unable to guess.
Norman, however, knew well enough, for he had travelled through
the country of the Assinoboil Indians, who take their name from this
very thing. He had also witnessed the operation performed by Crees,
Chippewas, and even voyageurs, where metal or earthen pots could
not be obtained.</p>

<p>On the next day the mystery was cleared up to Basil and Fran&ccedil;ois.
Lucien first collected a number of stones&mdash;about as large as paving-stones.
He chose such as were hard and smooth. These he flung
into the cinders, where they soon became red-hot. The water and
meat were now put into the bark pot, and then one stone after
another,&mdash;each being taken out as it got cooled,&mdash;until the water
came to a fierce boil. The rice and other ingredients were added at
the proper time, and in a short while an excellent soup was made.
So much, then, for the soup, and the boiled dishes with vegetables.
The roast, of course, was easily made ready upon green-wood spits,
and the &ldquo;game&rdquo; was cooked in a similar way. The fish were broiled
upon the red cinders, and eaten, as is usual, after the soup. There
were no puddings or pies, though, no doubt, Lucien could have made
such had they been wanted.</p>

<p>In their place there was an excellent service of fruit. There were
strawberries and raspberries, one sort of which found wild in this
region is of a most delicious flavour. There were gooseberries and
currants; but the most delicious fruit, and that which Fran&ccedil;ois liked
best, was a small berry of a dark blue colour, not unlike the huckleberry,
but much sweeter and of higher flavour. It grows on a low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
bush or shrub with ovate leaves; and this bush when it blossoms is
so covered with beautiful white flowers, that neither leaves nor
branches can be seen. There are no less than four varieties of it
known, two of which attain to the height of twenty feet or more.
The French Canadians call it &ldquo;le poire,&rdquo; but in most parts of America
it is known as the &ldquo;service-berry,&rdquo; although several other names are
given to it in different districts. Lucien informed his companions,
while they were crushing its sweet purplish fruit between their teeth,
that its botanical name is <i>Amelanchier</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; remarked Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;if we only had a cup of coffee and a
glass of wine, we might say that we had dined in fashionable style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; replied Lucien, &ldquo;we are better without the wine, and
as for the other I cannot give you that, but I fancy I can provide you
with a cup of tea if you only allow me a little time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tea!&rdquo; screamed Fran&ccedil;ois; &ldquo;why, there's not a leaf of tea nearer
than China; and for the sugar, not a grain within hundreds of miles!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Frank,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;nature has not been so ungenerous
here, even in such luxuries as tea and sugar. Look yonder! You
see those large trees with the dark-coloured trunks. What are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sugar-maples,&rdquo; replied Fran&ccedil;ois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;I think even at this late season we might
contrive to extract sap enough from them to sweeten a cup of tea.
You may try, while I go in search of the tea-plant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Luce, you are equal to a wholesale grocery.
Very well. Come, Basil, we'll tap the maples; let the captain go
with Luce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys, separating into pairs, walked off, in different directions.
Lucien and his companion soon lighted upon the object of their search
in the same wet bottom where they had procured the <i>Heracleum</i>. It
was a branching shrub, not over two feet in height, with small leaves
of a deep green colour above, but whitish and woolly underneath. It
is a plant well known throughout most of the Hudson's Bay territory
by the name of &ldquo;Labrador tea-plant;&rdquo; and is so called because the
Canadian voyageurs, and other travellers through these northern
districts, often drink it as tea. It is one of the <i>Ericace&aelig;</i>, or heath
tribe, of the genus <i>Ledum</i>&mdash;though it is not a true heath, as, strange
to say, no true heath is found upon the continent of America.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of it known,&mdash;the &ldquo;narrow-leafed&rdquo; and &ldquo;broad-leafed&rdquo;
and the former makes the best tea. But the pretty white
flowers of the plant are better for the purpose than the leaves of either
variety; and these it was that were now gathered by Lucien and
Norman. They require to be dried before the decoction is made; but
this can be done in a short time over a fire; and so in a short time it
was done, Norman having parched them upon heated stones.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Basil and Fran&ccedil;ois had obtained the sugar-water, and
Lucien having washed his soup-kettle clean, and once more made his
boiling stones red-hot, prepared the beverage; and then it was served
out in the tin cup, and all partook of it. Norman had drunk the
Labrador tea before, and was rather fond of it, but his Southern
cousins did not much relish it. Its peculiar flavour, which somewhat
resembles rhubarb, was not at all to the liking of Fran&ccedil;ois. All, however,
admitted that it produced a cheering effect upon their spirits;
and, after drinking it, they felt in that peculiarly happy state of mind
which one experiences after a cup of the real &ldquo;Bohea.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<div class="cap">THE MARMOTS OF AMERICA.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">F</span>rom such a luxurious dinner you may suppose that our young
voyageurs lived in prime style. But it was not always so. They had
their fasts as well as feasts. Sometimes for days they had nothing to
eat but the jerked deer-meat. No bread&mdash;no beer&mdash;no coffee, nothing
but water&mdash;dry venison and water. Of course, this is food enough
for a hungry man; but it can hardly be called luxurious living.
Now and then a wild duck, or a goose, or perhaps a young swan, was
shot; and this change in their diet was very agreeable. Fish were
caught only upon occasions, for often these capricious creatures refused
Fran&ccedil;ois' bait, however temptingly offered.</p>

<p>After three weeks' coasting the Lake, they reached the Saskatchewan,
and turning up that stream, now travelled in a due westerly
direction. At the Grand Rapids, near the mouth of this river, they
were obliged to make a portage of no less than three miles, but the
magnificent view of these &ldquo;Rapids&rdquo; fully repaid them for the toil
they underwent in passing them.</p>

<p>The Saskatchewan is one of the largest rivers in America, being full
1600 miles in length, from its source in the Rocky Mountains to its
<i>d&eacute;bouchure</i>, under the name of the &ldquo;Nelson River,&rdquo; in Hudson's Bay.
For some distance above Lake Winnipeg, the country upon its banks
is well wooded. Farther up, the river runs through dry sandy prairies
that extend westward to the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains. Many
of these prairies may be properly called &ldquo;deserts.&rdquo; They contain lakes
as salt as the ocean itself, and vast tracts&mdash;hundreds of square miles
in extent&mdash;where not a drop of water is to be met with. But the
route of our voyageurs did not lie over these prairies. It was their
intention, after reaching Cumberland House, to turn again in a
northerly direction.</p>

<p>One evening, when within two days' journey of the Fort, they had
encamped upon the bank of the Saskatchewan. They had chosen a
beautiful spot for their camp, where the country, swelling into rounded
hills, was prettily interspersed with bushy copses of <i>Amelanchiers</i>, and
<i>Rosa blanda</i> whose pale red flowers were conspicuous among the green
leaves, and filled the air with a sweet fragrance, that was wafted to
our voyageurs upon the sunny breeze. The ground was covered with
a grassy sward enamelled by the pink flowers of the <i>Cleome</i>, and the
deeper red blossoms of the beautiful wind-flower.</p>

<p>Upon that day our travellers had not succeeded in killing any game,
and their dinner was likely to consist of nothing better than dry
venison scorched over the coals. As they had been travelling all the
morning against a sharp current, and, of course, had taken turn about
at the paddles, they all felt fatigued, and none of them was inclined
to go in search of game. They had flung themselves down around
the fire, and were waiting until the venison should be broiled for
dinner.</p>

<p>The camp had been placed at the foot of a tolerably steep hill, that
rose near the banks of the river. There was another and higher hill
facing it, the whole front of which could be seen by our travellers as
they sat around their fire. While glancing their eyes along its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
declivity, they noticed a number of small protuberances or mounds
standing within a few feet of each other. Each of them was about a
foot in height, and of the form of a truncated cone&mdash;that is, a cone
with its top cut off, or beaten down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; inquired Fran&ccedil;ois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy,&rdquo; answered Lucien, &ldquo;they are marmot-houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; affirmed Norman; &ldquo;there are plenty of them in this
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! marmots!&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois. &ldquo;Prairie-dogs, you mean?&mdash;the
same we met with on the Southern prairies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; replied Norman: &ldquo;I think the prairie-dogs are a
different sort. Are they not, cousin Luce?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; answered the naturalist; &ldquo;these must be a different
species. There are too few of them to be the houses of prairie-dogs.
The 'dogs' live in large settlements, many hundreds of them in one
place; besides, their domes are somewhat different in appearance
from these. The mounds of the prairie-dogs have a hole in the top or
on one side. These, you see, have not. The hole is in the ground
beside them, and the hill is in front, made by the earth taken out of
the burrow, just as you have seen it at the entrance of a rat's hole.
They are marmots, I have no doubt, but of a different species from
the prairie-dog marmots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there not many kinds of marmots in America? I have heard
so,&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois.</p>

<p>This question was of course addressed to Lucien.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered he. &ldquo;The <i>fauna</i> of North America is peculiarly
rich in species of these singular animals. There are thirteen kinds of
them, well known to naturalists; and there are even some varieties
in these thirteen kinds that might almost be considered distinct species.
I have no doubt, moreover, there are yet other species which have not
been described. Perhaps, altogether, there are not less than twenty
different kinds of marmots in North America. As only one or two
species are found in the settled territories of the United States, it was
supposed, until lately, that there were no others. Latterly the naturalists
of North America have been very active in their researches, and
no genus of animals has rewarded them so well as the marmots&mdash;unless,
perhaps, it may be the squirrels. Almost every year a new
species of one or the other of these has been found&mdash;mostly inhabiting
the vast wilderness territories that lie between the Mississippi
and the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These little animals seem to form a link between the squirrels and
rabbits. On the side of the squirrels they very naturally join on,
if I may use the expression, to the ground-squirrel, and some of them,
differ but little in their habits from many of the latter. Other
species, again, are more allied to the rabbits, and less like the
squirrels; and there are two or three kinds that I should say&mdash;using
a Yankee expression&mdash;have a 'sprinkling' of the rat in them. Some,
as the ground-hog, or wood-chuck of the United States, are as large
as rabbits, while others, as the leopard-marmot, are not bigger than
Norway rats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some species have cheek-pouches, in which they can carry a large
quantity of seeds, nuts, and roots, when they wish to hoard them up
for future use. These are the spermophiles, and some species of
these have more capacious pouches than others. Their food differs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
somewhat, perhaps according to the circumstances in which they
may be placed. In all cases it is vegetable. Some, as the prairie-dogs,
live upon grasses, while others subsist chiefly upon seeds,
berries, and leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was long supposed that the marmots, like the squirrels, laid up
stores against the winter. I believe this is not the case with any of
the different species. I know for certain that most of them pass the
winter in a state of torpidity, and of course require no provisions, as
they eat nothing during that season. In this we observe one of those
cases in which Nature so beautifully adapts a creature to its circumstances.
In the countries where many of the marmots are found, so
severe are the winters, and so barren the soil, that it would be
impossible for these creatures to get a morsel of food for many long
months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During this period, therefore, Nature suspends her functions, by
putting them into a deep, and, for aught we know to the contrary, a
pleasant sleep. It is only when the snow melts, under the vernal
sun, and the green blades of grass and the spring flowers array
themselves on the surface of the earth, that the little marmots make
their appearance again. Then the warm air, penetrating into their
subterranean abodes, admonishes them to awake from their protracted
slumber, and come forth to the enjoyment of their summer
life. These animals may be said, therefore, to have no winter.
Their life is altogether a season of summer and sunshine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the marmots,&rdquo; continued Lucien, &ldquo;live in large communities,
as the prairie dogs; others, in smaller tribes, while still
other species lead a solitary life, going only in pairs, or at most in
families. Nearly all of them are burrowing animals, though there
are one or two species that are satisfied with a cleft in the rock,
or a hole among loose stones for their nests. Some of them are tree-climbers,
but it is supposed they only ascend trees in search of food,
as they do not make their dwellings there. Many of the species are
very prolific, the females bringing forth eight, and even ten young
at a birth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The marmots are extremely shy and watchful creatures. Before
going to feed, they usually reconnoitre the ground from the tops
of their little mounds. Some species do not have such mounds,
and for this purpose ascend any little hillock that may be near.
Nearly all have the curious habit of placing sentries to watch while
the rest are feeding. These sentries station themselves on some
commanding point, and when they see an enemy approaching give
warning to the others by a peculiar cry. In several of the species
this cry resembles the syllables 'seek-seek' repeated with a hiss.
Others bark like 'toy-dogs,' while still other kinds utter a whistling
noise, from which one species derives its trivial name of 'whistler'
among the traders, and is the 'siffleur' of the Canadian voyageurs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 'whistler's' call of alarm can be heard at a great distance;
and when uttered by the sentinel is repeated by all the others as far
as the troop extends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The marmots are eaten both by Indians and white hunters. Sometimes
they are captured by pouring water into their burrows; but
this method only succeeds in early spring, when the animals awake
out of their torpid state, and the ground is still frozen hard enough
to prevent the water from filtering away. They are sometimes shot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
with guns; but, unless killed upon the spot, they will escape to
their burrows, and tumble in before the hunter can lay his hands
upon them.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE BLAIREAU, THE &ldquo;TAWNIES,&rdquo; AND THE &ldquo;LEOPARDS.&rdquo;</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">P</span>erhaps Lucien would have carried his account of the marmots still
farther&mdash;for he had not told half what he knew of their habits&mdash;but
he was at that moment interrupted by the marmots themselves.
Several of them appeared at the mouths of their holes; and, after
looking out and reconnoitring for some moments, became bolder, and
ran up to the tops of their mounds, and began to scatter along the
little beaten paths that led from one to the other. In a short while
as many as a dozen could be seen moving about, jerking their tails,
and at intervals uttering their seek-seek.</p>

<p>Our voyageurs saw that there were two kinds of them, entirely
different in colour, size, and other respects. The larger ones were of
a greyish yellow above, with an orange tint upon the throat and
belly. These were the &ldquo;tawny marmots,&rdquo; called sometimes &ldquo;ground-squirrels,&rdquo;
and by the voyageurs, &ldquo;siffleurs,&rdquo; or &ldquo;whistlers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other species seen were the most beautiful of all the marmots.
They were very little smaller than the tawny marmots; but their
tails were larger and more slender, which rendered their appearance
more graceful. Their chief beauty, however, lay in their colours and
markings. They were striped from the nose to the rump with bands
of yellow and chocolate colour, which alternated with each other,
while the chocolate bands were themselves variegated by rows of
yellow spots regularly placed. These markings gave the animals
that peculiar appearance so well known as characterising the skin of
the leopard, hence the name of these little creatures was &ldquo;leopard
marmots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was plain from their actions that both kinds were &ldquo;at home&rdquo;
among the mounds, and that both had their burrows there. This
was the fact, and Norman told his companion that the two kinds are
always found together, not living in the same houses, but only as
neighbours in the same &ldquo;settlement.&rdquo; The burrows of the &ldquo;leopard&rdquo;
have much smaller entrances than those of their &ldquo;tawny kin,&rdquo; and
run down perpendicularly to a greater depth before branching off in
a horizontal direction. A straight stick may be thrust down one of
these full five feet before reaching an &ldquo;elbow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The holes of the tawny marmots, on the contrary, branch off near
the surface, and are not so deep under ground. This guides us to the
explanation of a singular fact&mdash;which is, that the &ldquo;tawnies&rdquo; make
their appearance three weeks earlier in spring than the &ldquo;leopards,&rdquo;
in consequence of the heat of the sun reaching them sooner, and
waking them out of their torpid sleep.</p>

<p>While these explanations were passing among the boys, the
marmots had come out, to the number of a score, and were carrying
on their gambols along the declivity of the hill. They were at too
great a distance to heed the movements of the travellers by the camp
fire. Besides, a considerable valley lay between them and the camp,
which, as they believed, rendered their position secure. They were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
not at such a distance but that many of their movements could be
clearly made out by the boys, who after a while noticed that several
furious battles were being fought among them. It was not the
&ldquo;tawnies&rdquo; against the others, but the males of each kind in single
combats with one another.</p>

<p>They fought like little cats, exhibiting the highest degree of
boldness and fury; but it was noticed that in these conflicts the
leopards were far more active and spiteful than their kinsmen. In
observing them through his glass Lucien noticed that they frequently
seized each other by the tails, and he further noticed that several of
them had their tails much shorter than the rest. Norman said that
these had been bitten off in their battles; and, moreover, that it
was a rare thing to find among the males, or &ldquo;bucks,&rdquo; as he called
them, one that had a perfect tail!</p>

<p>While these observations were being made, the attention of our
party was attracted to a strange animal that was seen slowly crawling
around the hill. It was a creature about as big as an ordinary
setter dog, but much thicker in the body, shorter in the legs, and
shaggier in the coat. Its head was flat, and its ears short and
rounded. Its hair was long, rough, and of a mottled hoary grey
colour, but dark-brown upon the legs and tail. The latter, though
covered with long hair, was short, and carried upright; and upon
the broad feet of the animal could be seen long and strong curving
claws. Its snout was sharp as that of a greyhound&mdash;though not so
prettily formed&mdash;and a white stripe, passing from its very tip over
the crown, and bordered by two darker bands, gave a singular
expression to the animal's countenance.</p>

<p>It was altogether, both in form and feature, a strange and vicious-looking
creature. Norman recognised it at once as the &ldquo;blaireau,&rdquo;
or American badger. The others had never seen such a creature
before&mdash;as it is not an inhabitant of the South, nor of any part of the
settled portion of the United States.</p>

<p>The badger when first seen was creeping along with its belly
almost dragging the ground, and its long snout projected horizontally
in the direction of the marmot &ldquo;village.&rdquo; It was evidently meditating
a surprise of the inhabitants. Now and then it would stop,
like a pointer dog when close to a partridge, reconnoitre a moment,
and then go on again. Its design appeared to be to get between the
marmots and their burrows, intercept some of them, and get a hold of
them without the trouble of digging them up&mdash;although that would be
no great affair to it, for so strong are its fore-arms and claws that in
loose soil it can make its way under the ground as fast as a mole.</p>

<p>Slowly and cautiously it stole along, its hind-feet resting all their
length upon the ground, its hideous snout thrown forward, and its
eyes glaring with a voracious and hungry expression. It had got
within fifty paces of the marmots, and would, no doubt, have succeeded
in cutting off the retreat of some of them, but at that moment
a burrowing owl that had been perched upon one of the mounds,
rose up, and commenced hovering in circles above the intruder.
This drew the attention of the marmot sentries to their well-known
enemy, and their warning cry was followed by a general scamper of
both tawnies and leopards towards their respective burrows.</p>

<p>The blaireau, seeing that further concealment was no longer of any
use, raised himself higher upon his limbs, and sprang forward in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
pursuit. He was too late, however, as the marmots had all got into
their holes, and their angry &ldquo;seek-seek&rdquo; was heard proceeding from
various quarters out of the bowels of the earth. The blaireau only
hesitated long enough to select one of the burrows into which he was
sure a marmot had entered; and then, setting himself to his work,
he commenced throwing out the mould like a terrier. In a few
seconds he was half buried, and his hind-quarters and tail alone
remained above ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/illus-084.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="THE BLAIREAU AND THE MARMOTS" title="THE BLAIREAU AND THE MARMOTS" />
<span class="caption">THE BLAIREAU AND THE MARMOTS</span></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>He would soon have disappeared entirely, but at that moment the
boys, directed and headed by Norman, ran up the hill, and, seizing
him by the tail, endeavoured to jerk him back. That, however, was
a task which they could not accomplish, for first one and then
another, and then Basil and Norman&mdash;who were both strong boys&mdash;pulled
with all their might, and could not move him. Norman
cautioned them against letting him go, as in a moment's time he
would burrow beyond their reach. So they held on until Fran&ccedil;ois
had got his gun ready. This the latter soon did, and a load of small
shot was fired into the blaireau's hips, which, although it did not
quite kill him, caused him to back out of the hole, and brought him
into the clutches of Marengo.</p>

<p>A desperate struggle ensued, which ended by the bloodhound
doubling his vast black muzzle upon the throat of the blaireau, and
choking him to death in less than a dozen seconds; and then his
hide&mdash;the only part which was deemed of any value&mdash;was taken off
and carried to the camp. The carcass was left upon the face
of the hill, and the red shining object was soon espied by the buzzards
and turkey vultures, so that in a few minutes' time several
of these filthy birds were seen hovering around, and alighting upon
the hill.</p>

<p>But this was no new sight to our young voyageurs, and soon
ceased to be noticed by them. Another bird, of a different kind, for
a short time engaged their attention. It was a large hawk, which
Lucien, as soon as he saw it, pronounced to be one of the kind known
as buzzards. Of these there are several species in North America,
but it is not to be supposed that there is any resemblance between
them and the buzzards just mentioned as having alighted by the
carcass of the blaireau. The latter, commonly called &ldquo;turkey
buzzards,&rdquo; are true vultures, and feed mostly, though not exclusively,
on carrion; while the &ldquo;hawk buzzards&rdquo; have all the appearance and
general habits of the rest of the falcon tribe.</p>

<p>The one in question, Lucien said, was the &ldquo;marsh-hawk,&rdquo; sometimes
also called the &ldquo;hen-harrier.&rdquo; Norman stated that it was
known among the Indians of these parts as the &ldquo;snake-bird,&rdquo; because
it preys upon a species of small green snake that is common on the
plains of the Saskatchewan, and of which it is fonder than of any
other food.</p>

<p>The voyageurs were not long in having evidence of the appropriateness
of the Indian appellation; for these people, like other savages,
have the good habit of giving names that express some quality or
characteristic of the thing itself. The bird in question was on the
wing, and from its movements evidently searching for game. It
sailed in easy circlings near the surface, <i>quartering</i> the ground like
a pointer dog. It flew so lightly that its wings were not seen to
move, and throughout all its wheelings and turnings it appeared to
be carried onwards or upwards by the power of mere volition.</p>

<p>Once or twice its course brought it directly over the camp, and
Fran&ccedil;ois had got hold of his gun, with the intention of bringing it
down, but on each occasion it perceived his motions; and, soaring
up like a paper-kite until out of reach, it passed over the camp, and
then sank down again upon the other side, and continued its
&ldquo;quarterings&rdquo; as before. For nearly half-an-hour it went on
man&#339;vring in this way, when all at once it was seen to make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
sudden turning in the air as it fixed its eyes upon some object in the
grass.</p>

<p>The next moment it glided diagonally towards the earth, and
poising itself for a moment above the surface, rose again with a small
green-coloured snake struggling in its talons. After ascending to
some height, it directed its flight towards a clump of trees, and was
soon lost to the view of our travellers.</p>

<p>Lucien now pointed out to his companions a characteristic of the
hawk and buzzard tribe, by which these birds can always be distinguished
from the true falcon. That peculiarity lay in the manner
of seizing their prey. The former skim forward upon it sideways&mdash;that
is, in a horizontal or diagonal direction, and pick it up in
passing; while the true falcons&mdash;as the merlin, the peregrine, the
gerfalcon, and the great eagle-falcons&mdash;shoot down upon their prey
<i>perpendicularly</i> like an arrow, or a piece of falling lead.</p>

<p>He pointed out, moreover, how the structure of the different kinds
of preying birds, such as the size and form of the wings and tail, as
well as other parts, were in each kind adapted to its peculiar mode
of pursuing its prey; and then there arose a discussion as to whether
this adaption should be considered a <i>cause</i>, or an <i>effect</i>. Lucien succeeded
in convincing his companions that the structure was the
effect and not the cause of the habit, for the young naturalist was a
firm believer in the changing and progressive system of nature.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">AN ODD SORT OF DECOY-DUCK.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>wo days after the adventure with the blaireau, the young voyageurs
arrived at Cumberland House&mdash;one of the most celebrated posts of
the Hudson's Bay Company. The chief factor, who resided there,
was a friend of Norman's father, and of course the youths were
received with the warmest hospitality, and entertained during their
stay in the best manner the place afforded. They did not make a
long stay, however, as they wished to complete their journey before
the winter should set in, when canoe-travelling would become impossible.</p>

<p>During winter, not only the lakes, but the most rapid rivers of
these Northern regions, become frozen up, and remain so for many
months. Nearly the whole surface of the earth is buried under deep
snow, and travelling can only be done with snow-shoes, or with
sledges drawn by dogs. These are the modes practised by the
Indians, the Esquimaux, and the few white traders and trappers who
have occasion in winter to pass from one point to another of that icy
and desolate region.</p>

<p>Travelling under such circumstances is not only difficult and
laborious, but is extremely perilous. Food cannot always be obtained&mdash;supplies
fall short, or become exhausted&mdash;game is scarce, or cannot
be found at all, as at that season many of the quadrupeds and most
of the birds have forsaken the country, and migrated to the South&mdash;and
whole parties of travellers&mdash;even Indians, who can eat anything
living or dead, roast or raw&mdash;often perish from hunger.</p>

<p>Our travellers were well acquainted with these facts; and being
anxious, therefore, to get to the end of their journey before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
winter should come down upon them, made all haste to proceed. Of
course they obtained a new &ldquo;outfit&rdquo; at the Fort; but they took with
them only such articles as were absolutely necessary, as they had many
portages to make before they could reach the waters of the Mackenzie
River. As it required two of the party to carry the canoe, with a few
little things besides, all the baggage was comprised in such loads as
the others could manage; and of course that was not a great deal,
for Fran&ccedil;ois was but a lad, and Lucien was far from being in robust
health. A light axe, a few cooking utensils, with a small stock of
provisions, and of course their guns, formed the bulk of their loads.</p>

<p>After leaving the Fort they kept for several days' journey up the
Saskatchewan. They then took leave of that river, and ascended a
small stream that emptied into it from the north. Making their first
portage over a &ldquo;divide,&rdquo; they reached another small stream that ran
in quite a different direction, emptying itself into one of the branches
of the Mississippi, or Churchill River. Following this in a north-westerly
course, and making numerous other portages, they reached
Lake La Crosse, and afterwards in succession, Lakes Clear, Buffalo,
and Methy.</p>

<p>A long &ldquo;portage&rdquo; from the last-mentioned lake brought them to
the head of a stream known as the &ldquo;Clear Water;&rdquo; and launching
their canoe upon this, they floated down to its mouth, and entered the
main stream of the Elk, or Athabasca, one of the most beautiful
rivers of America. They were now in reality upon the waters of the
Mackenzie itself, for the Elk, after passing through the Athabasca
takes from thence the name of Slave River, and having traversed Great
Slave Lake, becomes the Mackenzie&mdash;under which name it continues
on to the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>Having got, therefore, upon the main head-water of the stream
which they intended to traverse, they floated along in their canoe
with light hearts and high hopes. It is true they had yet fifteen
hundred miles to travel, but they believed that it was all down-hill
work now; and as they had still nearly two months of summer before
them, they doubted not being able to accomplish the voyage in good
time.</p>

<p>On they floated down stream, feasting their eyes as they went&mdash;for
the scenery of the Elk valley is of a most picturesque and pleasing
character; and the broad bosom of the stream itself, studded with
wooded islands, looked to our travellers more like a continuation of
lakes than a running river. Now they glided along without using an
oar, borne onward by the current; then they would take a spell at
the paddles, while the beautiful Canadian boat-song could be heard
as it came from the tiny craft, and the appropriate chorus &ldquo;Row,
brothers, row!&rdquo; echoed from the adjacent shores. No part of their
journey was more pleasant than while descending the romantic Elk.</p>

<p>They found plenty of fresh provisions, both in the stream itself and
on its banks. They caught salmon in the water, and the silver-coloured
hyodon, known among the voyageurs by the name of
&ldquo;Dor&eacute;.&rdquo; They shot both ducks and geese, and roast-duck or goose
had become an everyday dinner with them. Of the geese there
were several species. There were &ldquo;snow-geese,&rdquo; so called from their
beautiful white plumage; and &ldquo;laughing geese,&rdquo; that derive their
name from the circumstance that their call resembles the laugh of a
man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>The Indians decoy these by striking their open hand repeatedly
over the mouth while uttering the syllable &ldquo;wah.&rdquo; They also saw
the &ldquo;Brent goose,&rdquo; a well-known species, and the &ldquo;Canada goose,&rdquo;
which is the <i>wild goose par excellence</i>. Another species resembling
the latter, called the &ldquo;barnacle goose,&rdquo; was seen by our travellers.
Besides these, Lucien informed them that there were several other
smaller kinds that inhabit the northern countries of America. These
valuable birds are objects of great interest to the people of the fur
countries for months in the year. Whole tribes of Indians look to
them as a means of support.</p>

<p>With regard to ducks, there was one species which our travellers
had not yet met with, and for which they were every day upon the
look-out. This was the far-famed &ldquo;canvass-back,&rdquo; so justly celebrated
among the epicures of America. None of them had ever eaten of it,
as it is not known in Louisiana, but only upon the Atlantic coast of
the United States. Norman, however, had heard of its existence in
the Rocky Mountains&mdash;where it is said to breed&mdash;as well as in other
parts of the fur countries, and they were in hopes that they might
fall in with it upon the waters of the Athabasca.</p>

<p>Lucien was, of course, well acquainted with its &ldquo;biography,&rdquo; and
could have recognised one at sight; and as they glided along he volunteered
to give his companions some information, not only about this
particular species, but about the whole genus of these interesting
birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The canvass-back,&rdquo; began he, &ldquo;is perhaps the most celebrated and
highly-prized of all the ducks, on account of the exquisite flavour of
its flesh&mdash;which is thought by some epicures to be superior to that of
all other birds. It is not a large duck&mdash;rarely weighing over three
pounds&mdash;and its plumage is far from equalling in beauty that of
many other species. It has a red or chestnut-coloured head, a shining
black breast, while the greater part of its body is of a greyish colour;
but upon close examination this grey is found to be produced by a
whitish ground minutely mottled with zig-zag black lines. I believe
it is this mottling, combined with the colour, which somewhat
resembles the appearance and texture of ship's canvass, that has
given the bird its trivial name; but there is some obscurity about the
origin of this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shooting the canvass-backs is a source of profit to hundreds of
gunners who live around the Chesapeake Bay, as these birds command
a high price in the markets of the American cities. Disputes
have arisen between the fowlers of different States around the Bay
about the right of shooting upon it; and vessels full of armed men&mdash;ready
to make war upon one another&mdash;have gone out on this account.
But the government of these States succeeded in settling the matter
peacefully, and to the satisfaction of all parties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The canoe at this moment shot round a bend, and a long smooth
expanse of the river appeared before the eyes of our voyageurs.
They could see that upon one side another stream ran in, with a
very sluggish current; and around the mouth of this, and for a good
stretch below it, there appeared a green sedge-like water-grass, or
rushes. Near the border of this sedge, and in a part of it that was
thin, a flock of wild fowl was diving and feeding. They were small,
and evidently ducks; but the distance was yet too great for the
boys to make out to what species they belonged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>A single large swan&mdash;a trumpeter&mdash;was upon the water, between
the shore and the ducks, and was gradually making towards the
latter. Fran&ccedil;ois immediately loaded one of his barrels with swan,
or rather &ldquo;buck&rdquo; shot, and Basil looked to his rifle. The ducks were
not thought of&mdash;the trumpeter was to be the game. Lucien took out
his telescope, and commenced observing the flock. They had not
intended to use any precaution in approaching the birds, as they
were not extremely anxious about getting a shot, and were permitting
the canoe to glide gently towards them.</p>

<p>An exclamation from Lucien, however, caused them to change
their tactics. He directed them suddenly to &ldquo;hold water,&rdquo; and stop the
canoe, at the same time telling them that the birds ahead were
the very sort about which they had been conversing&mdash;the &ldquo;canvass-backs.&rdquo;
He had no doubt of it, judging from their colour, size, and
peculiar movements.</p>

<p>The announcement produced a new excitement. All four were
desirous not only of shooting, but of <i>eating</i>, a canvass-back; and
arrangements were set about to effect the former. It was known to
all that the canvass-backs are among the shyest of water-fowl, so
much so that it is difficult to approach them unless under cover.
While feeding, it is said, they keep sentinels on the look-out. Whether
this be true or not, it is certain that they never all dive together,
some always remaining above water, and apparently watching while
the others are under.</p>

<p>A plan to get near them was necessary, and one was suggested by
Norman, which was to tie bushes around the sides of the canoe, so
as to hide both the vessel and those in it. This plan was at once
adopted&mdash;the canoe was paddled up to the bank&mdash;thick bushes were
cut, and tied along the gunwale; and then our voyageurs climbed
in, and laying themselves as low as possible, commenced paddling
gently downward in the direction of the ducks. The rifles were laid
aside, as they could be of little service with such game. Fran&ccedil;ois'
double-barrel was the arm upon which dependence was now placed;
and Fran&ccedil;ois himself leaned forward in the bow in order to be ready,
while the others attended to the guidance of the vessel. The buckshot
had been drawn out, and a smaller kind substituted. The
swan was no longer cared for or even thought of.</p>

<p>In about a quarter of an hour's time, the canoe, gliding silently
along the edge of the sedge&mdash;which was the wild celery&mdash;came near
the place where the ducks were; and the boys, peeping through the
leafy screen, could now see the birds plainly. They saw that they
were not all canvass-backs, but that three distinct kinds of ducks
were feeding together. One sort was the canvass-backs themselves,
and a second kind very much resembled them, except that they were
a size smaller. These were the &ldquo;red-heads&rdquo; or &ldquo;pochards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third species was different from either. They had also heads
of a reddish colour, but of a brighter red, and marked by a white
band that ran from the root of the bill over the crown. This mark
enabled Lucien at once to tell the species. They were widgeons;
but the most singular thing that was now observed by our voyageurs
was the terms upon which these three kinds of birds lived with each
other. It appeared that the widgeon obtained its food by a regular
system of robbery and plunder perpetrated upon the community of
the canvass-backs. The latter, as Lucien explained, feeds upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
roots of the valisneria; but for these it is obliged to dive to the depth
of four or five feet, and also to spend some time at the bottom while
plucking them up. Now the widgeon is as fond of the &ldquo;celery&rdquo; as
the canvass-back, but the former is not a diver&mdash;in fact, never goes
under water except when washing itself or in play, and it has therefore
no means of procuring the desired roots. Mark, then, the plan
that it takes to effect this end.</p>

<p>Seated as near as is safe to the canvass-back, it waits until the
latter makes his <i>somersault</i> and goes down. It (the widgeon) then
darts forward so as to be sufficiently close, and, pausing again, scans
the surface with eager eye. It can tell where the other is at work, as
the blades of the plant at which it is tugging are seen to move above
the water. These at length disappear, pulled down as the plant is
dragged from its root, and almost at the same instant the canvass-back
comes up holding the root between his mandibles.</p>

<p>But the widgeon is ready for him. He has calculated the exact
spot where the other will rise; and, before the latter can open his
eyes or get them clear of the water, the widgeon darts forward,
snatches the luscious morsel from his bill, and makes off with it.
Conflicts sometimes ensue; but the widgeon, knowing himself to be
the lesser and weaker bird, never stands to give battle, but secures
his prize through his superior agility. On the other hand, the
canvass-back rarely attempts to follow him, as he knows that the
other is swifter upon the water than he. He only looks after his lost
root with an air of chagrin, and then, reflecting that there is &ldquo;plenty
more where it came from,&rdquo; kicks up its heels, and once more plunges
to the bottom.</p>

<p>The red-head rarely interferes with either, as he is contented to
feed upon the leaves and stalks, at all times floating in plenty upon
the surface.</p>

<p>As the canoe glided near, those on board watched these curious
man&#339;uvres of the birds with feelings of interest. They saw, moreover,
that the &ldquo;trumpeter&rdquo; had arrived among them, and the ducks
seemed to take no notice of him. Lucien was struck with something
unusual in the appearance of the swan. Its plumage seemed ruffled
and on end, and it glided along in a stiff and unnatural manner. It
moved its neck neither to one side nor the other, but held its head
bent forward, until its bill almost touched the water, in the attitude
that these birds adopt when feeding upon something near the surface.
Lucien said nothing to his companions, as they were all silent, lest
they might frighten the ducks; but Basil and Norman had also
remarked the strange look and conduct of the trumpeter. Fran&ccedil;ois'
eyes were bent only upon the ducks, and he did not heed the other.</p>

<p>As they came closer, first Lucien, and then Basil and Norman, saw
something else that puzzled them. Whenever the swan approached
any of the ducks, these were observed to disappear under the water.
At first, the boys thought that they merely dived to get out of his
way, but it was not exactly in the same manner as the others were
diving for the roots. Moreover, none of those that went down in the
neighbourhood of the swan were seen to come up again!</p>

<p>There was something very odd in all this, and the three boys,
thinking so at the same time, were about to communicate their
thoughts to one another, when the double crack of Fran&ccedil;ois' gun
drove the thing, for a moment, out of their heads; and they all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
looked over the bushes to see how many canvass-backs had been
killed. Several were seen dead or fluttering along the surface; but
no one counted them, for a strange, and even terrible, object now
presented itself to the astonished senses of all. If the conduct of the
swan had been odd before, it was now doubly so.</p>

<p>Instead of flying off after the shot, as all expected it would do, it
was now seen to dance and plunge about on the water, uttering loud
screams, that resembled the human voice far more than any other
sounds! Then it rose as if pitched into the air, and fell on its back
some distance off; while in its place was seen a dark, round object
moving through the water, as if making for the bank, and uttering,
as it went, the same hideous human-like screams!</p>

<p>This dark object was no other than the poll of a human being;
and the river shallowing towards the bank, it rose higher and higher
above the water, until the boys could distinguish the glistening
neck and naked shoulders of a red and brawny Indian! All was now
explained. The Indian had been duck-hunting, and had used the
stuffed skin of the swan as his disguise; and hence the puzzling
motions of the bird. He had not noticed the canoe&mdash;concealed as it
was&mdash;until the loud crack of Fran&ccedil;ois' gun had startled him from his
work.</p>

<p>This, and the heads and white faces of the boys peeping over the
bushes, had frightened him, even more than he had them. Perhaps
they were the first white faces he had ever seen. But, whether or
not, sadly frightened he was; for, on reaching the bank, he did not
stop, but ran off into the woods, howling and yelling as if Old Nick
had been after him: and no doubt he believed that such was the case.</p>

<p>The travellers picked up the swan-skin put of curiosity; and, in
addition to the ducks which Fran&ccedil;ois had killed, they found nearly a
score of these birds, which the Indian had dropped in his fright, and
that had afterwards risen to the surface. These were strung together,
and all had their necks broken.</p>

<p>After getting them aboard, the canoe was cleared of the bushes;
and the paddles being once more called into service, the little craft
shot down stream like an arrow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE SHRIKE AND THE HUMMING-BIRDS</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he picturesque scenery of the Elk appeared to be a favourite resort
with the feathered creation. Here our voyageurs saw many kinds of
birds; both those that migrate into the fur countries during summer,
and those that make their home there in the cold, dark days of
winter. Among the former were observed&mdash;the beautiful blue bird
of Wilson which, on account of its gentle and innocent habits, is quite
as much esteemed in America as the &ldquo;robin&rdquo; in England.</p>

<p>Another favourite of the farmer and the homestead, the purple
martin, was seen gracefully wheeling through the air; while, among
the green leaves, fluttered many brilliant birds. The &ldquo;cardinal grosbeak&rdquo;
with his bright scarlet wings; the blue jay, noisy and chattering;
the rarer &ldquo;crossbill&rdquo; with its deep crimson colour; and many
others, equally bright and beautiful, enlivened the woods, either with
their voice or their gaudy plumage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>There was one bird, however, that had neither &ldquo;fine feathers&rdquo; nor
an agreeable voice, but that interested our travellers more than any
of the others. Its voice was unpleasant to the ear, and sounded more
like the grating of a rusty hinge than anything else they could think
of. The bird itself was not larger than a thrush, of a light grey colour
above, white underneath, and with blackish wings. Its bill resembled
that of the hawks, but its legs were more like those of the woodpecker
tribe; and it seemed, in fact, to be a cross between the two.
It was neither the colour of the bird, nor its form, nor yet its song,
that interested our travellers, but its singular habits; and these they
had a fine opportunity of observing at one of their &ldquo;noon camps,&rdquo;
where they had halted to rest and refresh themselves during the hot
mid-day hours. The place was on one of the little islets, which was
covered with underwood, with here and there some larger trees. The
underwood bushes were of various sorts; but close to the spot where
they had landed was a large thicket of honeysuckle, whose flowers
were in full bloom, and filled the air with their sweet perfume.</p>

<p>While seated near these, Fran&ccedil;ois' quick eye detected the presence
of some very small birds moving among the blossoms. They were at
once pronounced to be humming-birds, and of that species known as
the &ldquo;ruby-throats&rdquo; so called, because a flake of a beautiful vinous
colour under the throat of the males exhibits, in the sun, all the
glancing glories of the ruby. The back, or upper parts, are of a
gilded green colour; and the little creature is the smallest bird that
migrates into the fur countries, with one exception, and that is a
bird of the same genus&mdash;the &ldquo;cinnamon humming-bird.&rdquo; The latter,
however, has been seen in the Northern regions, only on the western
side of the Rocky Mountains; but then it has been observed even as
far north as the bleak and inhospitable shores of Nootka Sound.
Mexico, and the tropical countries of America, are the favourite home
of the humming-birds; and it was, for a long time, supposed that the
&ldquo;ruby-throats&rdquo; were the only ones that migrated farther north than
the territory of Mexico itself. It is now known, that besides the
&ldquo;cinnamon humming-bird,&rdquo; two or three other species annually make
an excursion into higher latitudes.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;ruby-throats&rdquo; not only travel into the fur countries, but
breed in numbers upon the Elk River, the very place where our
travellers now observed them.</p>

<p>As they sat watching these little creatures, for there were several
of them skipping about and poising themselves opposite the flowers,
the attention of all was attracted to the movements of a far different
sort of bird. It was that one we have been speaking of. It was
seated upon a tree, not far from the honeysuckles; but every now and
then it would spring from its perch, dash forward, and after whirring
about for some moments among the humming-birds fly back to the
same tree.</p>

<p>At first the boys watched these man&#339;uvres without having their
curiosity excited. It was no new thing to see birds acting in this
manner. The jays, and many other birds of the fly-catching kind
have this habit, and nothing was thought of it at the moment.
Lucien, however, who had watched the bird more narrowly, presently
declared to the rest that it was catching the humming-birds, and
preying upon them&mdash;that each time it made a dash among the honeysuckles,
it carried off one in its claws, the smallness of the victim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
having prevented them at first from noticing this fact. They all now
watched it more closely than before, and were soon satisfied of the
truth of Lucien's assertion, as they saw it seize one of the ruby-throats
in the very act of entering the corolla of a flower.</p>

<p>This excited the indignation of Fran&ccedil;ois, who immediately took up
his &ldquo;double-barrel,&rdquo; and proceeded towards the tree where the bird,
as before, had carried this last victim. The tree was a low one, of the
locust or <i>pseud-acacia</i> family, and covered all over with great thorny
spikes, like all trees of that tribe. Fran&ccedil;ois paid no attention to
this; but, keeping under shelter of the underwood, he crept forward
until within shot. Then raising his gun, he took aim, and pulling
trigger, brought the bird fluttering down through the branches. He
stepped forward and picked it up&mdash;not that he cared for such unworthy
game, but Lucien had called to him to do so, as the naturalist
wished to make an examination of the creature.</p>

<p>He was about turning to go back to camp, when he chanced to
glance his eye up into the locust-tree. There it was riveted by a
sight which caused him to cry out with astonishment. His cry
brought the rest running up to the spot, and they were not less astonished
than he, when they saw the cause of it. I have said that
the branches of the tree were covered with long thorny spikes that
pointed in every direction; but one branch in particular occupied
their attention. Upon this there was about a dozen of these spikes
pointing upward, and upon each spike <i>was impaled a ruby-throat</i>!</p>

<p>The little creatures were dead, of course, but they were neither torn
nor even much ruffled in their plumage. They were all placed back
upwards, and as neatly spitted upon the thorns as if they had been
put there by human hands. On looking more closely it was discovered
that other creatures as well as the humming-birds, had been
served in a similar manner. Several grasshoppers, spiders, and some
coleopterous insects were found, and upon another branch two small
meadow-mice had been treated to the same terrible death.</p>

<p>To Basil, Norman, and Fran&ccedil;ois, the thing was quite inexplicable,
but Lucien understood well enough what it meant. All these
creatures, he informed them, were placed there by the bird which
Fran&ccedil;ois had shot, and which was no other than the &ldquo;shrike&rdquo; or
&ldquo;butcher-bird&rdquo;&mdash;a name by which it is more familiarly known, and
which it receives from the very habit they had just observed. Why
it follows such a practice Lucien could not tell, as naturalists are not
agreed upon this point. Some have asserted that it spits the spiders
and other insects for the purpose of attracting nearer the small birds
upon which it preys; but this cannot be true, for it preys mostly
upon birds that are not insect-eaters, as the finches: besides, it is itself
as fond of eating grasshoppers as anything else, and consumes large
quantities of these insects.</p>

<p>The most probable explanation of the singular and apparently cruel
habit of the butcher-bird is, that it merely places its victims upon the
thorns, in order to keep them safe from ground-ants, rats, mice,
raccoons, foxes, and other preying creatures&mdash;just as a good cook
would hang up her meat or game in the larder to prevent the cats
from carrying it off. The thorny tree thus becomes the storehouse of
the shrike, where he hangs up his superfluous spoil for future use,
just as the crows, magpies and jays, make their secret deposits in
chinks of walls and the hollows of trees. It is no argument against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
this theory, that the shrike sometimes leaves these stores without
returning to them. The fox, and dog, as well as many other preying
creatures have the same habit.</p>

<p>Wondering at what they had seen, the voyageurs returned to their
camp, and once more embarked on their journey.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE FISH-HAWK.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span> few days after, another incident occurred to our voyageurs, which
illustrated the habits of a very interesting bird, the &ldquo;osprey,&rdquo; or fish-hawk,
as it is more familiarly known in America.</p>

<p>The osprey is a bird of the falcon tribe, and one of the largest of the
genus&mdash;measuring two feet from bill to tail, with an immense spread
of wing in proportion, being nearly six feet from tip to tip. It is of
a dark brown colour above, that colour peculiar to most of the hawk
tribe, while its lower parts are ashy white. Its legs and bill are blue,
and its eyes of a yellow orange. It is found in nearly all parts of
America, where there are waters containing fish, for on these it exclusively
feeds. It is more common on the sea-coast than in the
interior, although it also frequents the large lakes, and lives in the
central parts of the continent during summer, when these are no
longer frozen over. It is not often seen upon muddy rivers, as there
it would stand no chance of espying its victims in the water. It is a
migratory bird, seeking the South in winter, and especially the shores
of the Great Mexican Gulf, where large numbers are often seen fishing
together.</p>

<p>In the spring season these birds move to the northward, and make
their appearance along the Atlantic coast of the continent, where they
diffuse joy into the hearts of the fishermen&mdash;because the latter know,
on seeing them, that they may soon expect the large shoals of herring,
shad, and other fish, for which they have been anxiously looking out.
So great favourites are they with the fisherman, that they would not
knowingly kill an osprey for a boat-load of fish, but regard these bold
fishing birds in the light of &ldquo;professional brethren.&rdquo; In this case the
old adage that &ldquo;two of a trade never agree&rdquo; is clearly contradicted.</p>

<p>The farmer often takes up his gun to fire at the osprey&mdash;mistaking
it for the red-tailed buzzard or some other hawk, several species of
which at a distance it resembles&mdash;but, on discovering his mistake,
brings down his piece without pulling trigger, and lets the osprey fly
off unharmed. This singular conduct on the part of the farmer arises
from his knowledge of the fact, that the osprey will not only <i>not</i> kill
any of his ducks or hens, but that where he makes a settlement he
will drive off from the premises all the hawks, buzzards, and kites,
that would otherwise prey upon the poultry. With such protection,
therefore, the osprey is one of the securest birds in America. He
may breed in a tree over the farmer's or fisherman's door without the
slightest danger of being disturbed in his incubation.</p>

<p>I say <i>his</i> incubation; but the male takes no part in this domestic
duty, further than to supply his loved mate with plenty of fish while
she does the hatching business. Of course, thus protected, the osprey
is not a rare bird. On the contrary, fish-hawks are more numerous
than perhaps any other species of the hawk tribe. Twenty or thirty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
nests may be seen near each other in the same piece of woods, and as
many as three hundred have been counted on one little island. The
nests are built upon large trees&mdash;not always at the tops, as those of
rooks, but often in forks within twenty feet of the ground. They are
composed of large sticks, with stalks of corn, weeds, pieces of wet turf,
and then lined plentifully with dry sea-grass, or any other grass that
may be most convenient.</p>

<p>The whole nest is big enough to make a load for a cart, and would
be heavy enough to give any horse a good pull. It can be seen, when
the woods are open, to an immense distance, and the more easily, as
the tree upon which it is built is always a &ldquo;dead wood,&rdquo; and therefore
without leaves to conceal it. Some say that the birds select a dead or
decaying tree for their nest. It is more probable such is the effect
and not the cause, of their building upon a particular tree. It is more
likely that the tree is killed partly by the mass of rubbish thus piled
upon it, and partly by the nature of the substances, such as sea-weed
in the nest, the oil of the fish, the excrement of the birds themselves,
and the dead fish that have been dropped about the root, and suffered
to remain there; for when the osprey lets fall his finny prey, which
he often does, he never condescends to pick it up again, but goes in
search of another.</p>

<p>Boys &ldquo;a-nesting&rdquo; might easily discover the nest of the osprey; but
were they inclined to despoil it of its three or four eggs (which are
about the size of a duck's, and blotched with Spanish brown), they
would find that a less easy task, for the owners would be very likely
to claw their eyes out, or else scratch the tender skin from their
beardless cheeks: so that boys do not often trouble the nest of the
osprey.</p>

<p>A very curious anecdote is related of a negro having climbed up to
plunder a nest of these birds. The negro's head was covered with a
close nap of his own black wool, which is supposed by a certain stretch
of fancy to have the peculiarity of &ldquo;growing in at both ends.&rdquo; The
negro, having no other protection than that which his thick fur
afforded him, was assailed by both the owners of the nest, one of
which, making a dash at the &ldquo;darkie's&rdquo; head, struck his talons so
firmly into the wool, that he was unable to extricate them, and there
stuck fast, until the astonished plunderer had reached the foot of the
tree. We shall not answer for the truthfulness of this anecdote,
although there is nothing improbable about it; for certain it is that
these birds defend their nests with courage and fury, and we know of
more than one instance of persons being severely wounded who made
the attempt to rob them.</p>

<p>The ospreys, as already stated, feed exclusively on fish. They are
not known to prey upon birds or quadrupeds of any kind, even when
deprived of their customary food, as they sometimes are for days on
account of the lakes and rivers, in which they expected to find it
being frozen over to a later season than usual. Other birds, as the
purple grakles, often build among the sticks of the osprey's nest, and
rear their young without being meddled with by this generous bird.
This is an important point of difference between the osprey and other
kinds of hawks; and there is a peculiarity of structure about the feet
and legs of the osprey, that points to the nature of his food and his
mode of procuring it. His legs are disproportionately long and strong.
They are without feathers nearly to the knees. The feet and toes are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
also very long, and the soles are covered with thick, hard scales, like the
teeth of a rasp, which enable the bird to hold securely his slippery
prey. The claws, too, are long, and curved into semicircles, with
points upon them almost as sharp as needles.</p>

<p>I have stated that an incident occurred to our party that illustrated
some of the habits of this interesting bird. It was upon the afternoon
of a Saturday, after they had fixed their camp to remain for the
following day. They had landed upon a point or promontory that
ran out into the river, and from which they commanded a view of a
fine stretch of water. Near where they had placed their tent was the
nest of an osprey, in the forks of a large poplar. The tree, as usual,
was dead, and the young were plainly visible over the edge of the
nest. They appeared to be full-grown and feathered; but it is a
peculiarity of the young ospreys that they will remain in the nest,
and be fed by the parent birds, until long after they might be considered
able to shift for themselves. It is even asserted that the
latter become impatient at length, and drive the young ones out of
the nest by beating them with their wings; but that for a considerable
time afterwards they continue to feed them&mdash;most likely until the
young birds learn to capture their finny prey for themselves.</p>

<p>This Lucien gave as a popular statement, but did not vouch for its
truth. It was not long, however, before both he and his companions
witnessed its complete verification.</p>

<p>The old birds, after the arrival of the voyageurs upon the promontory,
had remained for some time around the nest, and at intervals
had shot down to where the party was, uttering loud screams, and
making the air whizz with the strokes of their wings. Seeing that
there was no intention of disturbing them, they at length desisted
from these demonstrations, and sat for a good while quietly upon the
edge of their nest. Then first one, and shortly after the other, flew
out, and commenced sailing in circles, at the height of an hundred
feet or so above the water. Nothing could be more graceful than
their flight. Now they would poise themselves a moment in the air,
then turn their bodies as if on a pivot, and glide off in another direction.</p>

<p>All these motions were carried on with the most perfect ease, and
as if without the slightest aid from the wings. Again they would
come to a pause, holding themselves fixed in mid-air by a gentle
flapping, and appearing to scrutinise some object below. Perhaps it
was a fish; but it was either too large a one, or not the species most
relished, or maybe it had sunk to too great a depth to be easily taken.
Again they sail around; one of them suddenly arrests its flight, and,
like a stone projected from a sling, shoots down to the water. Before
reaching the surface, however, the fish, whose quick eye has detected
the coming enemy, has gone to the dark bottom and concealed himself;
and the osprey, suddenly checking himself by his wings and the
spread of his full tail, mounts again, and re-commences his curvilinear
flight.</p>

<p>After this had gone on for some time, one of the birds&mdash;the larger
one, and therefore the female&mdash;was seen to leave off hunting and
return to the nest. There she sat only for a few seconds, when, to the
astonishment of the boys, she began to strike her wings against the
young ones, as if she was endeavouring to force them from the nest.
This was just what she designed doing. Perhaps her late unsuccessful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
attempt to get them a fish had led her to a train of reflections,
and sharpened her determination to make them shift for themselves.
However that may be, in a few moments she succeeded in driving
them up to the edge, and then, by half pushing, and half beating
them with her wings, one after the other&mdash;two of them there were&mdash;was
seen to take wing, and soar away out over the lake.</p>

<p>At this moment, the male shot down upon the water, and then
rose again into the air, bearing a fish, head-foremost, in his talons.
He flew directly towards one of the young, and meeting as it hovered
in the air, turned suddenly over and held out the fish to it. The latter
clutched it with as much ease as if it had been accustomed to the thing
for years, and then turning away, carried the fish to a neighbouring
tree, and commenced devouring it.</p>

<p>The action had been perceived by the other youngster, who followed
after, and alighted upon the same branch, with the intention of
sharing in the meal. In a few minutes the best part of the fish was
eaten up, and both, rising from the branch, flew back to their nest.
There they were met by the parents, and welcomed with a loud
squeaking, that was intended, no doubt, to congratulate them upon
the success of their first &ldquo;fly.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE OSPREY AND HIS TYRANT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span>fter remaining for some time on the nest along with the others,
the old male again resolved to &ldquo;go a-fishing,&rdquo; and with this intent he
shot out from the tree, and commenced wheeling above the water.
The boys, having nothing better to engage them, sat watching his
motions, while they freely conversed about his habits and other points
in his natural history. Lucien informed them that the osprey is a bird
common to both Continents, and that it is often seen upon the shores
of the Mediterranean, pursuing the finny tribes there, just as it does
in America. In some parts of Italy it is called the &ldquo;leaden eagle,&rdquo;
because its sudden heavy plunge upon the water is fancied to resemble
the falling of a piece of lead.</p>

<p>While they were discoursing, the osprey was seen to dip once or
twice towards the surface of the water, and then suddenly check himself,
and mount upward again. These man&#339;uvres were no doubt
caused by the fish which he intended to &ldquo;hook&rdquo; having suddenly
shifted their quarters. Most probably experience had taught them
wisdom, and they knew the osprey as their most terrible enemy. But
they were not to escape him at all times. As the boys watched the
bird, he was seen to poise himself for an instant in the air, then suddenly
closing his wings, he shot vertically downward.</p>

<p>So rapid was his descent, that the eye could only trace it like a bolt
of lightning. There was a sharp whizzing sound in the air&mdash;a plash
was heard&mdash;then the smooth bosom of the water was seen to break,
and the white spray rose several feet above the surface. For an
instant the bird was no longer seen. He was underneath, and the
place of his descent was marked by a patch of foam. Only a single
moment was he out of sight. The next he emerged, and a few strokes
of his broad wing carried him into the air, while a large fish was seen
griped in his claws. As the voyageurs had before noticed, the fish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
was carried head-foremost, and this led them to the conclusion that
in striking his prey beneath the water the osprey follows it and aims
his blow from behind.</p>

<p>After mounting a short distance the bird paused for a moment in
the air, and gave himself a shake, precisely as a dog would do after
coming out of water. He then directed his flight, now somewhat slow
and heavy, toward the nest. On reaching the tree, however, there
appeared to be some mismanagement. The fish caught among the
branches as he flew inward. Perhaps the presence of the camp had
distracted his attention, and rendered him less careful. At all events,
the prey was seen to drop from his talons; and bounding from branch
to branch, went tumbling down to the bottom of the tree.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more opportune than this, for Fran&ccedil;ois had not
been able to get a &ldquo;nibble&rdquo; during the whole day, and a fresh fish for
dinner was very desirable to all. Fran&ccedil;ois and Basil had both started
to their feet, in order to secure the fish before the osprey should
pounce down and pick it up; but Lucien assured them that they need
be in no hurry about that, as the bird would not touch it again after
he had once let it fall. Hearing this, they took their time about it,
and walked leisurely up to the tree, where they found the fish lying.
After taking it up they were fain to escape from the spot, for the
effluvium arising from a mass of other fish that lay in a decomposed
state around the tree was more than any delicate pair of nostrils
could endure.</p>

<p>The one they had secured proved to be a very fine salmon of not
less than six pounds weight, and therefore much heavier than the
bird itself! The track of the osprey's talons was deeply marked;
and by the direction in which the creature was scored, it was evident
the bird had seized it from behind. The old hawks made a considerable
noise while the fish was being carried away; but they soon gave
up their squealing, and, once more hovering out over the river, sailed
about with their eyes bent upon the water below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a number of fish they must kill!&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois. &ldquo;They
don't appear to have much difficulty about it. I should think they
get as much as they can eat. See! there again! Another, I declare!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Fran&ccedil;ois spoke the male osprey was seen to shoot down as
before, and this time, although he appeared scarcely to dip his foot
in the water, rose up with a fish in his talons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have sometimes others to provide for besides themselves,&rdquo;
remarked Lucien. &ldquo;For instance, the bald eagle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucien was interrupted by a cackling scream, which was at once
recognised as that of the very bird whose name had just escaped his
lips. All eyes were instantly turned in the direction whence it came&mdash;which
was from the opposite side of the river&mdash;and there, just in the
act of launching itself from the top of a tall tree, was the great enemy
of the osprey&mdash;the white-headed eagle himself!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now a chase!&rdquo; cried Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;yonder comes the big robber!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With some excitement of feeling, the whole party watched the
movements of the birds. A few strokes of the eagle's wing brought
him near; but the osprey had already heard his scream, and knowing
it was no use carrying the fish to his nest, turned away from it, and
rose spirally upward, in the hope of escaping in that direction. The
eagle followed, beating the air with his broad pinions, as he soared
after. Close behind him went the female osprey, uttering wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
screams, flapping her wings against his very beak, and endeavouring
to distract his attention from the chase. It was to no purpose, however,
as the eagle full well knew her object, and disregarding her impotent
attempts, kept on in steady flight after her mate. This continued
until the birds had reached a high elevation, and the ospreys,
from their less bulk, were nearly out of sight. But the voyageurs
could see that the eagle was on the point of overtaking the one that
carried the fish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/illus-099.jpg" width="347" height="500" alt="THE OSPREY AND WHITE-HEADED EAGLE." title="THE OSPREY AND WHITE-HEADED EAGLE." />
<span class="caption">THE OSPREY AND WHITE-HEADED EAGLE.</span></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>Presently, a glittering object dropped down from the heavens, and
fell with a plunge upon the water. It was the fish, and almost at
the same instant was heard the &ldquo;whish!&rdquo; of the eagle, as the great
bird shot after it. Before reaching the surface, however, his white
tail and wings were seen to spread suddenly, checking his downward
course; and then, with a scream of disappointment, he flew off in a
horizontal direction, and alit upon the same tree from which he had
taken his departure. In a minute after the ospreys came shooting
down, in a diagonal line, to their nest; and, having arrived there, a
loud and apparently angry consultation was carried on for some time,
in which the young birds bore as noisy a part as either of their
parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a wonder,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;the eagle missed the fish&mdash;he rarely
does. The impetus which he can give his body enables him to overtake
a falling object before it can reach the earth. Perhaps the
female osprey was in his way, and hindered him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did he not pick it up in the water?&rdquo; demanded Fran&ccedil;ois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it went to the bottom, and he could not reach it&mdash;that's
clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Basil who made answer, and the reason he assigned was the
true one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's too bad,&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;that the osprey, not half so big a
bird, must support this great robber-tyrant by his industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's no worse than among our own kind,&rdquo; interposed Basil. &ldquo;See
how the white man makes the black one work for him here in
America. That, however, is the <i>few</i> toiling for the <i>million</i>. In
Europe the case is reversed. There, in every country, you see the
million toiling for the few&mdash;toiling to support an oligarchy in luxurious
case, or a monarch in barbaric splendour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why do they do so? the fools!&rdquo; asked Fran&ccedil;ois, somewhat
angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because they know no better. That oligarchy, and those monarchs,
have taken precious care to educate and train them to the
belief that such is the <i>natural</i> state of man. They furnish them with
school-books, which are filled with beautiful sophisms&mdash;all tending to
inculcate principles of endurance of wrong, and reverence for their
wrongers. They fill their rude throats with hurrah songs that paint
false patriotism in glowing colours, making loyalty&mdash;no matter to
whatsoever despot&mdash;the greatest of virtues, and revolution the
greatest of crimes; they studiously divide their subjects into several
creeds, and then, playing upon the worst of all passions&mdash;the passion
of religious bigotry&mdash;easily prevent their misguided helots from
uniting upon any point which would give them a real reform. Ah!
it is a terrible game which the present rulers of Europe are playing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Basil who gave utterance to these sentiments, for the young
republican of Louisiana had already begun to think strongly on
political subjects. No doubt Basil would one day be an M.C.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bald eagles have been much blamed for their treatment of
the ospreys, but,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;perhaps they have more reason for
levying their tax than at first appears. It has been asked: Why
they do not capture the fish themselves? Now, I apprehend, that
there is a <i>natural</i> reason why they do not. As you have seen, the
fish are not always caught upon the surface. The osprey has often
to plunge beneath the water in the pursuit, and Nature has gifted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
him with power to do so, which, if I am not mistaken, she has denied
to the eagles. The latter are therefore compelled, in some measure,
to depend upon the former for a supply. But the eagles sometimes
do catch the fish themselves, when the water is sufficiently shallow,
or when their prey comes near enough to the surface to enable them
to seize it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they ever kill the ospreys?&rdquo; inquired Fran&ccedil;ois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; replied Lucien; &ldquo;that would be 'killing the goose,'
etc. They know the value of their tax-payers too well to get rid of
them in that way. A band of ospreys, in a place where there happens
to be many of them together, have been known to unite and drive
the eagles off. That, I suppose, must be looked upon in the light of a
successful <i>revolution</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation was here interrupted by another incident. The
ospreys had again gone out fishing, and, at this moment, one of them
was seen to pounce down and take a fish from the water. It was a
large fish, and, as the bird flew heavily upward, the eagle again left
its perch, and gave chase. This time the osprey was overtaken
before it had got two hundred yards into the air, and seeing it was
no use attempting to carry off the prey, it opened its claws and let it
drop.</p>

<p>The eagle turned suddenly, poised himself a moment, and then
shot after the falling fish. Before the latter had got near the
ground, he overtook and secured it in his talons. Then, arresting
his own flight by the sudden spread of his tail, he winged his way
silently across the river, and disappeared among the trees upon the
opposite side. The osprey, taking the thing as a matter of course,
again descended to the proper elevation, and betook himself to his
work. Perhaps he grinned a little, like many another royal taxpayer,
but he knew the tax had to be paid all the same, and he said
nothing.</p>

<p>An incident soon after occurred that astonished and puzzled our
party not a little. The female osprey, that all this time seemed to
have had but poor success in her fishing, was now seen to descend
with a rush, and plunge deeply into the wave. The spray rose in a
little cloud over the spot, and all sat watching with eager eyes to
witness the result. What was their astonishment when, after waiting
many seconds, the bird still remained under water! Minutes passed,
and still she did not come up. <i>She came up no more!</i> The foam she
had made in her descent floated away&mdash;the bosom of the water was
smooth as glass&mdash;not a ripple disturbed its surface. They could have
seen the smallest object for a hundred yards or more around the spot
where she had disappeared.</p>

<p>It was impossible she could have emerged without them seeing her.
Where, then, had she gone? This, as I have said, puzzled the whole
party; and formed a subject of conjecture and conversation for the
rest of that day, and also upon the next. Even Lucien was unable
to solve the mystery. It was a point in the natural history of the
osprey unknown to him. Could she have drowned herself? Had
some great fish, the &ldquo;gar pike,&rdquo; or some such creature, got hold of
and swallowed her? Had she dashed her head against a rock, or
become entangled in weeds at the bottom of the river?</p>

<p>All these questions were put, and various solutions of the problem
were offered. The true one was not thought of, until accident<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
revealed it. It was Saturday when the incident occurred. The party,
of course, remained all next day at the place. They heard
almost continually the cry of the bereaved bird, who most likely
knew no more than they what had become of his mate. On Monday
our travellers re-embarked and continued down-stream. About a mile
below, as they were paddling along, their attention was drawn
to a singular object floating upon the water. They brought the
canoe alongside it.</p>

<p>It was a large fish, a sturgeon, floating dead, with a bird beside it,
also dead! On turning both over, what was their astonishment to see
that the talons of the bird were firmly fixed in the back of the
fish! It was the <i>female osprey</i>! This explained all. She had
struck a fish too heavy for her strength, and being unable to clear
her claws again, had been drawn under the water and had perished
along with her victim!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER, XXII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE VOYAGE INTERRUPTED.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span>bout ten days' rapid travelling down the Elk River brought our
party into the Athabasca Lake&mdash;sometimes called the &ldquo;Lake of the
Hills.&rdquo; This is another of those great bodies of fresh water that lie
between the primitive rocks of the &ldquo;Barren Grounds,&rdquo; and the more
fertile limestone deposit upon the west. It is nearly two hundred
miles long from west to east, and it is only fifteen miles in breadth,
but in some places it is so narrow and full of islands that it looks
more like a broad river than a lake. Its shores and many of its
islands are thickly wooded, particularly upon the southern and
western edges; and the eye of the traveller is delighted with many
a beautiful vista as he passes along. But our voyageurs took little heed
of these things.</p>

<p>A gloom had come over their spirits, for one of their party had
taken ill, and was suffering from a painful and dangerous disease&mdash;an
intermittent fever. It was Lucien&mdash;he that was beloved by all
of them. He had been complaining for several days&mdash;even while
admiring the fair scenery of the romantic Elk&mdash;but every day he had
been getting worse, until, on their arrival at the lake, he declared
himself no longer able to travel. It became necessary, therefore,
to suspend their journey; and choosing a place for their camp, they
made arrangements to remain until Lucien should recover. They built
a small log-hut for the invalid, and did everything to make him as
comfortable as possible. The best skins were spread for his couch; and
cooling drinks were brewed for him from roots, fruits, and berries, in
the way he had already taught his companions to prepare them.</p>

<p>Every day Fran&ccedil;ois went forth with his gun, and returned with
a pair of young pigeons, or a wood-partridge, or a brace of the
beautiful ruffed grouse; and out of these he would make delicate
soups, which he was the better able to do as they had procured salt,
pepper, and other ingredients, at the Fort. They had also brought
with them a stock of tea&mdash;the real China tea&mdash;and sugar; and as the
quantity of both was but small, this luxurious beverage was made
exclusively for Lucien, and was found by him exceedingly beneficial
during his illness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>To the great joy of all the invalid was at length restored to health,
and the canoe being once more launched and freighted, they continued
their journey.</p>

<p>They coasted along the shores of the lake, and entered the Great
Slave River, which runs from the Athabasca into the Great Slave
Lake. They soon came to the mouth of another large river, called
the Peace. This runs into the Great Slave a short distance below
Lake Athabasca, and, strange to say, the sources of the Peace River
lie upon the <i>western</i> side of the Rocky Mountains, so that this stream
actually runs across the mountain-chain! It passes through the
mountains in a succession of deep gorges, which are terrible to behold.
On both sides dizzy cliffs and snow-capped peaks rise thousands of
feet above its rocky bed, and the scenery is cold and desolate.</p>

<p>Its head-waters interlock with those of several streams that run
into the Pacific; so that, had our voyageurs wished to travel to the
shores of that ocean, they might have done so in their birch-bark
canoe nearly the whole of the way. But this was not their design at
present, so they passed the <i>d&eacute;bouchure</i> of the Peace, and kept on for
the Great Slave Lake. They were still upon the same water as the
Elk, for the Great Slave is only another name for that part of the
river lying between the two lakes&mdash;Athabasca and Great Slave. Of
course the river had now become much larger by the influx of the
Peace, and they were travelling upon the bosom of a magnificent
stream, with varied scenery upon its banks.</p>

<p>They were not so happy, however, as when descending the Elk&mdash;not
but that they were all in good health, for Lucien had grown quite
strong again. No, it was not any want of health that rendered them
less cheerful. It was the prospect before them&mdash;the prospect of
coming winter, which they now felt certain would arrive before they
had got to the end of their journey. The delay of nearly a month,
occasioned by Lucien's illness, had deranged all their calculations;
and they had no longer any hope of being able to finish their voyage
in what remained of the short summer. The ice would soon make
its appearance; the lakes and rivers would be frozen up; they could
no longer navigate them in their canoe. To travel afoot would be
a most laborious undertaking, as well as perilous in an extreme
degree.</p>

<p>In this way it is only possible to carry a very small quantity of
provisions&mdash;for the traveller is compelled to load himself with skin-clothing
in order to keep out the cold. The chances of procuring
game by the way in that season are precarious, and not to be
depended upon. Most of the birds and many of the quadrupeds
migrate to more southern regions; and those that remain are shy
and rare. Besides, great snow-storms are to be encountered, in
which the traveller is in danger of getting &ldquo;smoored.&rdquo; The earth is
buried under a deep covering of snow, and to pass over this while
soft is difficult, and at times quite impossible. All these circumstances
were known to our young voyageurs&mdash;to Norman better than
any of them&mdash;and of course the prospect was a cheerless one&mdash;much
more so than those unacquainted with the winter of these dreary
regions would be willing to believe.</p>

<p>It was the month of August, near its end, when they reached the
Great Slave Lake, in the latitude of 62&deg;. The days had now become
very short, and their journeys grew short in proportion. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
already experienced weather as cold as an English winter. There
were slight frosts at night&mdash;though not yet enough to cover the
water with ice&mdash;and the mid-day hours were hot, sometimes too hot
to be comfortable. But this only caused them to feel the cold the
more sensibly when evening set in; and all their robes and skins
were necessary to keep them warm during the night.</p>

<p>The Great Slave Lake, like the Athabasca, is very long and very
narrow. It extends full 260 miles from east to west, but at its widest
part is not over thirty, and in some places much less. Along its
northern shores lies the edge of the &ldquo;Barren Grounds,&rdquo; and there
nothing meets the eye but bleak and naked hills of primitive rock.
On its southern side the geology is entirely of a different character.
There the limestone prevails, and scarcely anything that deserves
the name of hill is to be seen. There are fine forests too, in which
poplars, pines, and birches, are the principal trees. The lake is filled
with islands, many of which are wholly or partially covered with
timber of these kinds, and willows also are abundant.</p>

<p>There are fish of several species in its waters&mdash;which are in many
places of great depth&mdash;sixty fathoms deep&mdash;and in some of the
islands, and around the wooded shores, game exists in abundance in
the summer season. Even in winter it is not scarce, but then it
is difficult to follow it on account of the deep snow. Many of the
animals, too, at this season become torpid, and are of course hidden
in caves and hollow trees, and even in the snow itself, where no one
can find them. Notwithstanding all this, our voyageurs knew that
it would be the best place for them to make their winter camp.
They saw that to complete their journey during that season would
be impossible. Even had it been a month earlier it would have
been a difficult undertaking.</p>

<p>In a few days winter would be upon them. They would have
to stop somewhere. There was no place where they could so safely
stay as by the lake. One thing they would have there, which might
not be found so plenty elsewhere, that was wood for their fire; and
this was an inducement to remain by the lake. Having made up
their minds, therefore, to encamp on some part of it, they looked
from day to day for a place that would be most suitable, still
continuing their journey towards its western end. As yet no place
appeared to their liking, and as the lake near its western point
trends away towards the south, Norman proposed that they should
follow the shore no longer, but strike across to a promontory on the
northern shore of the lake, known as &ldquo;Slave Point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This promontory is of the limestone formation, and as Norman had
heard, is well wooded, and stocked with game. Even buffaloes are
found there. It is, in fact, the farthest point to the north-east that
these animals range, and this presents us with a curious fact. It is
the farthest point that the limestone deposit extends in that direction.
Beyond that, to the east and north, lie the primitive rocks of the
Barren Grounds, into which the buffaloes never stray. Thus we
observe the connexion that exists between the <i>fauna</i> of a country and
its geological character.</p>

<p>Of course they all agreed to Norman's proposal. The canoe was,
therefore, headed for the open waters; and, after a hard day's
paddling&mdash;for there was a head-wind&mdash;the voyageurs landed upon a
small wooded island, about half-way over the lake, where they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
encamped for the night, intending next day to cross the remaining
part.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">FISHING UNDER THE ICE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>n awaking next morning, to their great surprise, they saw that the
<i>lake was frozen over</i>! They had almost anticipated as much, for the
night was one of the coldest they had yet experienced&mdash;so cold that
one and all of them had slept but badly. As yet the ice was thin,
but so much the worse. It was thick enough to prevent them from
using the canoe, but too thin to bear their weight, and they now saw
that they were <i>prisoners upon the island</i>!</p>

<p>It was not without some feelings of alarm that they made this discovery;
but their fears were allayed by reflecting, that they could
remain upon the island until the ice either thawed away or become
strong enough to bear them, and then they could cross upon it to the
northern shore. With this consolation, therefore, they set about
making their temporary quarters upon the island as snug as circumstances
would permit. Their apprehensions, however, began to
return again, when several days had passed over, and the ice neither
grew any thinner nor any thicker, but seemed to remain at a stand-still.
In the early part of the morning it was almost strong enough
to bear them; but during the day the sun melted it, until it was
little better than a scum over the surface of the water.</p>

<p>The alarm of our voyageurs increased. Their provisions were
nearly out. There was no game on the islet&mdash;not so much as a bird&mdash;for
they had beaten every bush, and found nothing. Once or twice
they thought of launching their canoe and breaking a way for it
through the ice. But they knew that this proceeding would be one
of much labour as well as danger. The islet was full ten miles from
the shore, and they would therefore have to break the ice for ten
miles. Moreover, to stand up in a bark canoe, so as to get at the
work, would be a difficult task. It could not be accomplished without
endangering the equilibrium of the vessel, and indeed without upsetting
it altogether. Even to lean forward in the bow would be a
perilous experiment; and under these considerations the idea of
breaking a way was abandoned.</p>

<p>But their provisions were at length entirely exhausted, and what
was to be done? The ice was still too weak to carry them. Near the
shore it might have been strong enough, but farther out lay the
danger. There they knew it was thinner, for it had not frozen over
until a later period. It would have been madness to have risked it
yet. On the other hand, they were starving, or likely to starve from
hunger, by staying where they were. There was nothing eatable on
the island. What was to be done? In the water were fish&mdash;they
doubted not that&mdash;but how were they to catch them? They had
tried them with hook and line, letting the hook through a hole in the
ice; but at that late season the fish would not take a bait, and
although they kept several continually set, and &ldquo;looked&rdquo; them most
regularly and assiduously, not a &ldquo;tail&rdquo; was taken.</p>

<p>They were about to adopt the desperate expedient, now more
difficult than ever, of breaking their way through the ice, when, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
at once, it occurred to Norman, that, if they could not coax the fish
to take a bait, they might succeed better with a net, and capture
them against their will. This idea would have been plausible enough,
had there been a net; but there was no net on that islet, nor perhaps
within an hundred miles of it. The absence of a net might have been
an obstacle to those who are ever ready to despair; but such an
obstacle never occurred to our courageous boys. They had two
<i>parchment</i> skins of the caribou which they had lately killed, and out
of these Norman proposed to make a net.</p>

<p>He would soon do it, he said, if the others would set to work and
cut the deer-skins into thongs fine enough for the purpose. Two of
them, therefore, Basil and Lucien, took out their knives, and went
briskly to work; while Fran&ccedil;ois assisted Norman in twining the
thongs, and afterwards held them, while the latter wove and knotted
them into meshes. In a few hours both the skins were cut into fine
strips, and worked up; and a net was produced nearly six yards in
length by at least two in width. It was rude enough, to be sure, but
perhaps it would do its work as well as if it had been twined out of
silk. At all events, it was soon to have a trial&mdash;for the moment it
was finished the sinkers were attached to it, and it was carried down
to the edge of the water.</p>

<p>The three &ldquo;Southerners&rdquo; had never seen a net set under ice&mdash;for in
their country ice is an uncommon thing, and indeed never freezes of
sufficient thickness to carry the weight of a man. They were therefore
very curious to know how the thing was to be done. They could
not conceive how the net was to be stretched under the ice, in such a
manner as to catch the fish. Norman, however, knew all about it.
He had seen the Indians, and had set many a one himself. It was no
new thing for him, and he set about it at once.</p>

<p>He first crept out upon the ice to the distance of about twenty or
thirty yards from the shore. He proceeded cautiously, as the ice
creaked under him. Having arrived at the place where he intended
to set the net, he knelt down, and with his knife cut several holes in
the ice, at the distance of about six feet from each other, and all in
one line. He had already provided himself with a straight sapling
of more than six feet in length, to one end of which he had attached
a cord. The other end of this cord was tied to the net, at one of its
corners. He now thrust the sapling through the first hole he had
made, and then guided it so as to pass directly under the second.</p>

<p>At this hole he took a fresh hold of the stick, and passed it along
to the next, and so on to the last, where he pulled it out again, and
of course along with it the string. The net was not drawn into the
first hole, and by means of the cord already received through, was
pulled out to its full length. The sinkers, of course, fell down in the
water, and drew it into a vertical position. At both its upper corners
the net was made fast above the ice, and was now &ldquo;set.&rdquo; Nothing
more could be done until the fish came into it of their own accord,
when it could be drawn out upon the ice by means of the cord
attached; and, of course, by the same means could easily be returned
to its place, and set again.</p>

<p>All of them now went back to the fire, and with hungry looks sat
around it, waiting the result. They had made up their minds, should
no fish be caught, to get once more into the canoe and attempt
breaking their way to the shore. Summoning all their patience,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
therefore, they waited for nearly two hours, without examining the
net. Then Norman and Basil crawled back upon the ice, to see what
fortune had done for them. They approached the spot, and, with
their hearts thumping against their ribs, untied the knot and commenced
hauling out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly feels heavy,&rdquo; said Basil, as the net was being drawn.
&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;Something kicks, hurrah!&rdquo; and with the
second &ldquo;hurrah!&rdquo; a beautiful fish was pulled up through the hole,
and landed upon the ice. A loud &ldquo;hurrah&rdquo; was uttered in response
by Lucien and Fran&ccedil;ois&mdash;who, fearing the ice might not bear so
many, had remained upon the shore. A yard or two more of the net
was cleared, and a second fish still larger than the former was greeted
with a general &ldquo;hurrah!&rdquo; The two fish were now taken out&mdash;as
these were all that had been caught&mdash;and the net was once more
carefully set. Basil and Norman came back to the shore&mdash;Norman
to receive quite a shower of compliments from his companions.</p>

<p>The fish&mdash;the largest of which weighed nearly five pounds&mdash;proved
to be trout; and it was not long before their quality was put to the
proof. All declared they had never eaten so fine trout in their lives;
but when the condition of their appetites is taken into account, we
may infer that there was, perhaps, a little exaggeration in this statement.
If hunger really makes good sauce, our voyageurs had the best
of sauce with their fish, as each of them was as hungry as a half-famished
wolf.</p>

<p>They felt quite relieved, as far as present appetite went, but they
were still uneasy for the future. Should they not succeed in taking
more fish&mdash;and it was by no means certain they should succeed&mdash;they
would be no better off than ever. Their anxiety, however, was soon
removed. Their second &ldquo;haul&rdquo; proved even more successful than the
first&mdash;as five fish, weighing together not less than twenty pounds,
were pulled up.</p>

<p>This supply would enable them to hold out for a long time, but
they had not much longer to remain on the islet. Upon that very
night there was one of those severe frosts known only in high
latitudes, and the ice upon the lake became nearly a foot in thickness.
They had no longer any fear of its breaking under their weight; and
taking their canoe with all their &ldquo;traps,&rdquo; they set out to cross over
upon the ice. In a few hours they reached the shore of the lake, near
the end of the promontory, where they chose a spot, and encamped.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<div class="cap">AN ODD ALARM.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he first thing our voyageurs did after choosing a suitable situation,
was to build a log-hut. Being young backwoodsmen this was but a
trifle to them. All four of them knew how to handle an axe with
dexterity. The logs were soon cut and notched, and a small cabin
was put up, and roofed with split clap-boards. With the stones that
lay near the shore of the lake they built a chimney. It was but a
rude structure, but it drew admirably. Clay was wanted to &ldquo;chink&rdquo;
the cabin, but that could not be had, as the ground was hard frozen,
and it was quite impossible to make either clay or mud.</p>

<p>Even hot water poured out would freeze into ice in a few minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
This was a serious want&mdash;for in such a cold climate even the smallest
hole in the walls will keep a house uncomfortable, and to fill the
interstices between the logs, so as to make them air-tight, some soft
substance was necessary. Grass was suggested, and Lucien went off
in search of it. After awhile he returned with an armful of half-withered
grass, which all agreed would be the very thing; and a
large quantity was soon collected, as it grew plentifully at a short
distance from the cabin.</p>

<p>They now set to work to stuff it into the chinks; when, to their
astonishment, they found that this grass had a beautiful smell, quite
as powerful and as pleasant as that of mint or thyme! When a
small quantity of it was flung into the fire it filled the cabin with a
fragrance as agreeable as the costliest perfumes. It was the &ldquo;scented
grass,&rdquo; which grows in great profusion in many parts of the Hudson's
Bay territory, and out of which the Indians often make their beds,
burning it also upon the fire to enjoy its aromatic perfume.</p>

<p>For the first day or two, at their new abode, the travellers had
lived altogether on fish. They had, of course, brought their net with
them from the island, and had set it near the shore in the same way
as before. They had captured as many as they wanted, and, strange
to say, at one haul they found no less than five different species in
the net! One kind, a white fish, the <i>Coregonus albus</i> of naturalists,
but which is named &ldquo;tittameg&rdquo; by the fur-traders, they caught in
great plenty. This fish is found in nearly all the lakes and rivers of
the Hudson's Bay territory, and is much prized both by whites and
Indians for its delicate flavour. At some of the trading posts it
often forms, for weeks together, the only food which the residents
can obtain; and they are quite satisfied when they can get enough
of it. The tittameg is not a large fish; the largest attain to the
weight of about eight pounds.</p>

<p>There was another and still smaller species, which, from its colour,
the voyageurs call the &ldquo;poisson bleu,&rdquo; or blue fish. It is the <i>Coregonus
signifer</i> of ichthyologists. It is a species of grayling, and frequents
sharp-running water, where it will leap at the fly like a trout.
Several kinds of trout also inhabit the Great Slave Lake, and some of
these attain to the enormous weight of eighty pounds! A few were
caught, but none of so gigantic proportions as this. Pike were also
taken in the net, and a species of burbot. This last is one of the
most voracious of the finny tribe, and preys upon all others that it is
able to swallow. It devours whole quantities of cray-fish, until its
stomach becomes crammed to such a degree as to distort the shape of
its whole body. When this kind was drawn out, it was treated very
rudely by the boys&mdash;because its flesh was known to be extremely
unsavoury, and none of them cared to eat it. Marengo, however, had
no such scruples, and he was wont to make several hearty meals each
day upon the rejected burbot.</p>

<p>A fish diet exclusively was not the thing; and as our party soon
grew tired of it, the hunter Basil shouldered his rifle, and strode off
into the woods in search of game. The others remained working
upon the cabin, which was still far from being finished.</p>

<p>Basil kept along the edge of the lake in an easterly direction. He
had not gone more than a quarter of a mile, when he came upon a
dry gravelly ridge, which was thickly covered with a species of pine-trees
that resembled the Scotch fir. These trees were not over forty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
feet in height, with very thick trunks and long flexible branches.
No other trees grew among them, for it is the nature of this pine&mdash;which
was the &ldquo;scrub&rdquo; or grey pine&mdash;to monopolise the ground
wherever it grows. As Basil passed on, he noticed that many of the
trees were completely &ldquo;barked,&rdquo; particularly on the branches; and
small pieces of the bark lay scattered over the ground, as though it
had been peeled off and gnawed by some animal. He was walking
quietly on and thinking what creature could have made such a
wreck, when he came to a place where the ground was covered with
fine sand or dust.</p>

<p>In this, to his astonishment, he observed what he supposed to be
the tracks of human feet! They were not those of a man, but small
tracks, resembling the footsteps of a child of three or four years of
age. He was about stooping down to examine them more closely,
when a voice sounded in his ears exactly like the cry of a child!
This brought him suddenly to an erect attitude again, and he looked
all round to discover who or what had uttered that strange cry.
He could see no one&mdash;child or man&mdash;and strange, too, for he had a
clear view through the tree-trunks for several hundred yards around.
He was filled with curiosity, not unmixed with alarm; and, stepping
forward a few paces, he was about to bend down and examine the
tracks a second time, when the singular cry again startled him.</p>

<p>This time it was louder than before, as if he was closer to whatever
had uttered it, but Basil now perceived that it proceeded from above
him. The creature from which it came was certainly not upon the
ground, but high up among the tops of the trees. He looked up, and
there, in the fork of one of the pines, he perceived a singular and
hideous-looking animal&mdash;such as he had never before seen. It was of
a brown colour, about the size of a terrier-dog, with thick shaggy
hair, and clumped up in the fork of the tree&mdash;so that its head and
feet were scarcely distinguishable.</p>

<p>Its odd appearance, as well as the peculiar cry which it had uttered,
would have alarmed many a one of less courage than our young
hunter, and Basil was at first, as he afterwards confessed, &ldquo;slightly
flurried;&rdquo; but a moment's reflection told him what the animal was&mdash;one
of the most innocent and inoffensive of God's creatures&mdash;the
Canada porcupine. It was this, then, that had barked the scrub
pines&mdash;for they are its favourite food; and it was its track&mdash;which
in reality very much resembles that of a child&mdash;that Basil had seen
in the sand.</p>

<p>The first thought of the young hunter was to throw up his rifle,
and send a bullet through the ungainly animal; which, instead of
making any effort to escape, remained almost motionless, uttering, at
intervals, its child-like screams. Basil, however, reflected that the
report of his rifle would frighten any large game that might chance
to be near; and as the porcupine was hardly worth a shot, he concluded,
upon reflection, it would be better to leave it alone. He
knew&mdash;for he had heard Lucien say so&mdash;that he would find the
porcupine at any time, were it a week, or even a month after&mdash;for
these creatures remain sometimes a whole winter in the same grove.
He resolved, therefore, should no other game turn up, to return for
it; and, shouldering his rifle again, he continued his course through
the woods.</p>

<p>As he proceeded, the timber became thinner. The scrub-pines gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
place to poplar-trees, with here and there an undergrowth of willows.
The trees stood far apart, and the willows grew only in clumps or
&ldquo;islands,&rdquo; so that the view was nearly open for many hundred yards
around. Basil walked on with all the silence and watchfulness of a
true &ldquo;still&rdquo; hunter&mdash;for, among backwoodsmen, this species of
hunting is so called. He ascended a low hill, and keeping a tree in
front of him, looked cautiously over its crest. Before him, and
stretching from the bottom of the hill, was a level tract of considerable
extent.</p>

<p>It was bounded on one side by the edge of the lake, and on all the
others by thin woods, similar to those through which the hunter had
been for some time travelling. Here and there, over the plain, there
stood trees, far apart from each other, and in nowise intercepting the
view for a mile or more. The ground was clear of underwood, except
along the immediate edge of the lake, which was fringed by a thicket
of willows.</p>

<p>As Basil looked over the hill, he espied a small group of animals
near the interior border of the willows. He had never seen animals
of the same species before, but the genus was easily told. The tall
antlered horns, that rose upon the head of one of them, showed that
they were deer of some kind; and the immense size of the creature
that bore them, together with his ungainly form, his long legs, and
ass-like ears, his huge head with its overhanging lip, his short neck
with its standing mane, and, above all, the broad palmation of the
horns themselves, left Basil without any doubt upon his mind that
the animals before him were moose-deer&mdash;the largest, and perhaps
the most awkward, of all the deer kind.</p>

<p>The one with the antlers was the male or bull-moose. The others
were the female and her two calves of the preceding year. The
latter were still but half-grown, and, like the female, were without
the &ldquo;branching horns&rdquo; that adorned the head of the old bull. They
were all of a dark-brown colour&mdash;looking blackish in the distance&mdash;but
the large one was darker than any of the others.</p>

<p>Basil's heart beat high, for he had often heard of the great moose,
but now saw it for the first time. In his own country it is not found,
as it is peculiarly a creature of the cold regions, and ranges no farther
to the south than the northern edge of the United States territory.
To the north it is met with as far as timber grows&mdash;even to the
shores of the Polar Sea! Naturalists are not certain, whether or
not it be the same animal with the elk of Europe. Certainly the
two are but little, if anything, different; but the name &ldquo;elk&rdquo; has
been given in America to quite another and smaller species of deer&mdash;the
wapiti.</p>

<p>The moose takes its name from its Indian appellation, &ldquo;moos&ouml;&#259;,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;wood-eater;&rdquo; and this name is very appropriate, as the animal lives
mostly upon the leaves and twigs of trees. In fact, its structure&mdash;like
that of the camelopard&mdash;is such that it finds great difficulty in
reaching grass, or any other herbage, except where the latter chances
to be very tall, or grows upon the declivity of a very steep hill.
When it wishes to feed upon grass, the moose usually seeks it in such
situations; and it may often be seen browsing up the side of a hill,
with its legs spread widely on both sides of its neck. But its favourite
food is found at a more convenient height, and consists of the young
shoots of many species of trees. It prefers those of the poplar, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
birch-tree, and willows, and one kind of these last, the red willow, is
its particular favourite.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;striped&rdquo; maple is also much relished by the moose&mdash;hence the
name &ldquo;moose-wood,&rdquo; by which this tree is known among the hunters.
It loves also the common water-lilies, and in summer it may be seen
wading out into lakes, and plucking up their succulent leaves. It
takes to the water also for other purposes&mdash;to cool its body, and rid
itself of several species of gnats and mosquitoes that at this season
torment it exceedingly. At such times it is more easily approached;
and the Indians hunt it in their canoes, and kill it in the water, both
with spears and arrows. They never find the moose, however, in
large numbers&mdash;for it is a solitary animal, and only associates in pairs
during one part of the year, and in families at another season&mdash;as
Basil now found it.</p>

<p>In winter the Indians track it through the snow, following it upon
snow-shoes. These give them the advantage of skimming along the
surface, while the moose plunges through the deep rift, and is therefore
impeded in its flight. Notwithstanding, it will frequently
escape from the hunter, after a <i>chase of several days' duration</i>! Sometimes,
in deep snow, a dozen or more of these animals will be found
in one place, where they have got accidentally together. The snow
will be trodden down until the place appears as if enclosed by a wall.
This the hunters term a &ldquo;moose-pound,&rdquo; and when found in such
situations the moose are easily approached and surrounded&mdash;when a
general <i>battue</i> takes place, in which few or none of the animals are
allowed to escape.</p>

<p>I have said that Basil's heart beat high at the sight of the moose.
He was very desirous of killing one&mdash;partly on account of the novelty
of the thing, and partly because he and his companions at the camp
were anxious for a change of diet. Moose-meat was the very thing;
and he knew that if he could return to camp with a few pieces of this
strung over his gun, he would receive a double welcome. He was
well aware that the flesh of the moose was of the most savoury and
delicate kind, and that the long pendulous upper lip is one of the
&ldquo;tit-bits&rdquo; of the fur countries. Moreover, the fine hide would be an
acceptable addition to their stock, as it is the best of all deer-skins
for mocassins, as well as snow-shoes&mdash;articles which Basil knew would
soon be needed. For these reasons he was unusually desirous of killing
one of the moose.</p>

<p>He knew it would be difficult to approach them. He had heard
that they were shyest at that very season&mdash;the beginning of winter&mdash;and
indeed such is the case. No deer is so difficult to get a shot at
as a moose in early winter. In summer it is not so&mdash;as then the musquitoes
torment these animals to such a degree that they pay less
heed to other enemies, and the hunter can more easily approach them.
In winter they are always on the alert. Their sense of smell&mdash;as well
as of sight and hearing&mdash;is acute to an extreme degree, and they are
cunning besides. They can scent an enemy a long distance off&mdash;if
the wind be in their favour&mdash;and the snapping of a twig, or the
slightest rustle of the leaves, is sufficient to start them off.</p>

<p>In their journeyings through the snow, when they wish to rest
themselves, they make a sort of <i>d&eacute;tour</i>, and, coming back, lie down
near the track which they have already passed over. This gives them
an opportunity of hearing any enemy that may be following upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
their trail, and also of making off in a side-direction, while the latter
will be looking steadfastly ahead for them.</p>

<p>Basil had heard of all these tricks of the moose&mdash;for many an old
moose-hunter had poured his tale into Basil's ear. He proceeded,
therefore, with all due caution. He first buried his hand in his game-bag,
and after a little groping brought out a downy feather which
had chanced to be there. This he placed lightly upon the muzzle of
his rifle, and having gently elevated the piece above his head, watched
the feather. After a moment, the breeze carried it off, and Basil
noted the direction it took. This is called, in hunter phrase, &ldquo;tossing
the feather,&rdquo; and gave Basil the exact direction of the wind&mdash;an important
knowledge in the present case.</p>

<p>To Basil's gratification he saw that it was blowing down the lake,
and nearly towards himself. He was not exactly to leeward of the
moose; but, what was better still, the willows that fringed the lake
were, for he could see them bending from the deer, as the breeze blew
freshly. He knew he could easily get among the willows; and as
they were not quite leafless, and, moreover, were interspersed with
tall reed grass, they formed a tolerable cover under which he might
make his approach.</p>

<p>Without losing time, then, he made for the willows, and placing
them between himself and the game, commenced &ldquo;approaching&rdquo;
along the shore of the lake.</p>

<p>He had a full half-hour's creeping&mdash;at one time upon his hands and
knees&mdash;at another crawling flat upon his breast like a gigantic lizard,
and now and then, at favourable spots, walking in a bent attitude.
A full half-hour was he, and much pain and patience did it cost him,
before getting within shot. But Basil was a hunter, and knew both
how to endure the pain and practise the patience&mdash;virtues that, in
hunting as well as in many other occupations usually meet with their
reward. And Basil was likely to meet with his, for on parting the
leaves, and looking cautiously through, he saw that he had arrived
at the right spot. Within fifty yards of him he saw the high shoulders
of the bull-moose and his great flat antlers towering over the tops of
the willows, among the leaves of which the snout of the animal was
buried. He also caught a glimpse of parts of the other three beyond;
but he thought only of the bull, and it was upon him that he kept his
eyes fixed. Basil did not think of the quality of the meat, else he
would have selected either the cow or one of the calves. Had it been
buffaloes he would certainly have done so; but as he had never killed
a moose, he was determined to slay the leader of the herd.</p>

<p>Indeed, had he wished to shoot one of the others, it might not have
been so easy, as they were farther off, and he could only see the tops
of their shoulders over the willows. Neither did the bull offer a fair
mark. He stood face to face with the hunter, and Basil fancied that
a shot on the frontal bone might not kill him. He knew it would
not kill a buffalo. There was only one other part at which he could
aim&mdash;the fore-shoulder; and after waiting some moments for the
animal to give him a fairer chance he took aim at this and fired. He
heard a loud cracking of hoofs, as the cow and calves shambled off
over the plain, but he saw that the bull was not with them. He was
down behind the willows. No doubt he was dead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<div class="cap">ENCOUNTER WITH A MOOSE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">W</span>hat was a rare thing for Basil to do, he rushed forward without
reloading his gun. A few springs brought him into the open ground,
and in presence of the game. To his astonishment, the bull was not
dead, nor down neither, but only upon his knees&mdash;of course wounded.
Basil saw the &ldquo;crease&rdquo; of the bullet along the neck of the animal as
he drew near. It was only by a quick glance that he saw this, for
as soon as the bull saw <i>him</i> he rose to his full height&mdash;his eyes flashing
like a tiger's&mdash;and settling his antlers in a forward position, sprang
upon the hunter! Basil leaped aside to avoid the encounter; and
in the first rush was successful, but the animal turned suddenly, and,
coming up a second time, raised his fore-feet high in the air, and
struck forward with his long-pointed hoofs.</p>

<p>Basil attempted to defend himself with his rifle, but the piece was
struck out of his hand in an instant. Once more avoiding the forward
rush of the infuriated beast, the young hunter looked around
for some object to save him. A tree fell under his eye, and he ran
towards it with all his speed. The moose followed close upon his
heels, and he had just time to reach the tree and get around its
trunk, when the animal brushed past, tearing the bark with his
sharp antlers. Basil now slipped round the trunk, and when the
moose again turned himself the two were on opposite sides of the
tree! The beast, however, rushed up, and struck the tree furiously
first with his brow antlers, and then with his hoofs, uttering loud
snorts, and at intervals a shrill whistling sound that was terrible to
hear.</p>

<p>The disappointment which the enraged animal felt, at seeing his
enemy thus escape him, seemed to have added to his rage; and he
now vented his spite upon the tree, until the trunk, to the height of
six feet, was completely stripped of its bark. While this was going
on, Basil remained behind the tree, &ldquo;dodging&rdquo; round as the moose
man&#339;uvred, and taking care always to have the animal on the
opposite side. To have got into a safer situation he would have
climbed the tree; but it happened to be a poplar, without a branch
for many feet from the ground, and of too great a girth to be &ldquo;embraced.&rdquo;
He could do nothing, therefore, but remain upon the
ground, and keep the tree-trunk between himself and the bull.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour this lasted, the moose now remaining at rest
for a few minutes, and then making fresh onsets that seemed to abate
nothing in their fury. His rage appeared to be implacable, and his
vengeance as tenacious as that of a tiger or any other beast of prey.
The wound which the hunter had given him was no doubt painful,
and kept his resentment from cooling. Unfortunately, it was not a
mortal wound, as Basil had every opportunity of seeing. The bullet
had hit the fore-shoulder; but, after tearing along the skin, had
glanced off without injuring the bone. It had only enraged the bull,
without crippling him in the least degree.</p>

<p>Basil began to dread the result. He was becoming faint with
fatigue as well as hunger. When would he be relieved? When would
the fierce brute feel inclined to leave him? These were questions
which the hunter put to himself repeatedly, without being able to
divine an answer. He had heard of hunters being killed by wounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
moose. He had heard that these creatures will remain for days
watching a person whom they may have &ldquo;treed.&rdquo; He could not
stand it for days. He would drop down with fatigue, and then the
bull would gore and trample him at pleasure. Would they be able
to trace him from the camp? They would not think of that before
nightfall. They would not think of him as &ldquo;lost&rdquo; before that time;
and then they could not follow his trail in the darkness, nor even
in the light&mdash;for the ground was hard as a rock, and he had made
no footmarks. Marengo might trace him. The dog had been left
at the camp, as Basil preferred &ldquo;still-hunting&rdquo; without him. But
in his present situation the hunter's apprehensions were stronger
than his hopes. Even Marengo might be baffled in lifting the
scent.</p>

<p>The trail was an exceedingly devious one, for Basil had meandered
round the sides of the hill in search of game. Deer or other animals
might have since crossed it, which might mislead the hound. It
would be cold at night, and much colder next morning. There were
many chances that no relief might reach him from the camp. Impressed
with this conviction, Basil began to feel serious alarm. Not
despair, however&mdash;he was not the boy to despair. His mind only
grew more alive to the necessity for action. He looked around to
discover some means of escape. His gun lay not a hundred yards off.
Could he only get hold of the piece, and return safely to the tree
again, he could there load it and put an end to the scene at once.
But to reach the gun was impossible. The moose would bound after
and overtake him to a certainty. The idea of getting the gun was
abandoned.</p>

<p>In the opposite direction to that in which the gun lay, Basil perceived
that there were other trees. The nearest was but a dozen
yards from him; and others, again, grew at about the same distance
from that one, and from each other. Basil now conceived the idea
of escaping to the nearest, and from that to the next, and by this
means getting back into the thick forest. Once there, he believed
that he would be the better able to effect his escape, and perhaps
reach the camp by dodging from tree to tree. He could beat the
moose for a dozen yards&mdash;getting a little the start of him&mdash;and this
he hoped to be able to do. Should he fail in his short race, however&mdash;should
his foot slip&mdash;the alternative was fearful. <i>It was no other
than death!</i></p>

<p>He knew that, but it did not change his resolution to make the
attempt. He only waited for the animal to work round between him
and the tree towards which he intended to run. You will wonder
that he did not prefer to have the moose on the other side. But he
did not, for this reason&mdash;had the bull been there, he could have
sprung after him at the first start; whereas, when heading the other
way, Basil believed he could brush close past, and gain an advantage,
as the unwieldy brute, taken by surprise, would require some time
in turning himself to give chase.</p>

<p>The opportunity at length arrived; and, nerving himself for the
race, the hunter sprang past the moose, brushing the very tips of its
antlers. He ran without either stopping or even looking back, until
he had reached the tree, and sheltered himself behind its trunk. The
moose had followed, and arrived but the moment after, snorting and
whistling furiously. Enraged at the <i>ruse</i>, it attacked this tree, as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
had the other, with hoof and horns; and Basil nimbly evaded both
by keeping on the opposite side, as before.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he prepared himself for a second rush, and once
more started. A third tree was reached in safety&mdash;and then a fourth,
and a fifth, and many others, in a similar manner&mdash;the moose all the
while following in hot pursuit. Basil had begun to hope that in
this way he would get off, when, to his chagrin, he saw that an open
space still intervened between him and the thick woods, upon which
there were only a few trees, and those so small that not one of them
would have sheltered him. This tract was full two hundred yards
in width, and extended all along the edge of the thick forest. He
dared not cross it. The moose would overtake him before he could
get half the way; and he was obliged to give up the idea of making
the attempt.</p>

<p>As he stood behind the last tree he had reached, he saw that it
branched, and the lowest branches grew but a little above his head.
He could easily climb it, and at once resolved to do so. He would
there be safe for the time, and could at least rest himself, for he was
now weak with fatigue. He therefore stretched up his hands, and,
laying hold of a branch, swung himself up into the tree. Then,
climbing up a little higher, he sat down on one of the forks.</p>

<p>The moose appeared as furious as ever; and ran round the tree,
now striking it with his horns, and then rearing upon his hind-legs,
and pouncing against the trunk with his hoofs. At times his snout
was so close to Basil, that the latter could almost touch it; and he
had even drawn his hunting-knife, and reached down with the intent
of giving the creature a stab.</p>

<p>This last action led to a train of thought, and Basil seemed suddenly
to adopt some new resolution. Leaving the fork where he had
perched himself, he climbed higher up the tree; and, selecting one
of the longest and straightest branches, commenced cutting it off close
to the trunk. This was soon effected; and then, drawing it along
his knee, he trimmed off all the twigs and tops until the branch
became a straight pole, like a spear-handle. Along one end of this
he laid the handle of his knife; and with thongs, which he had
already cut out of the strap of his bullet-pouch, he spliced the knife
and pole together. This gave him a formidable weapon&mdash;for the
knife was a &ldquo;bowie,&rdquo; and had a long blade, with a point like a rapier.
He was not slow in using it.</p>

<p>Descending again to the lowermost limbs, he commenced making
demonstrations, in order to bring the moose within reach. This he
very soon succeeded in doing; and the animal ran forward and reared
up against the tree. Before it could get upon its four legs again,
Basil had thrust it in the neck, giving full force to the blow. The
blood rushed forth in a thick stream, as the jugular vein had been
cut by the keen blade; and the huge brute was seen to totter in its
steps, and then fall with a dull heavy sound to the earth. In a few
moments the hunter had the satisfaction of perceiving that it was
quite dead.</p>

<p>Basil now dropped out of the tree, and walking back to where his
rifle lay, took up the piece and carefully reloaded it. He then
returned to the moose, and opening the great jaws of the animal,
gagged them with a stick. He next unspliced his knife, took off the
gristly lips, and cut out the tongue. These he placed in his game-bag,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
and shouldering his rifle, was about to depart; when some new
idea caused him to halt, put down his gun, and again unsheath his
knife. Once more approaching the carcass, he made an incision near
the kidneys; and having inserted his hand, drew forth what appeared
to be a part of the intestines. It was the bladder. He then looked
around as if in search of something. Presently his eye rested upon
some tall reed-grass that was growing near. This was just what he
wanted, and, pulling up one of the stems, he cut and fashioned it
into a pipe.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>With this the moose-bladder was blown out to its full dimensions,
and tied at the neck by a piece of thong. The other end of the
thong was fastened to one of the branches of the tree above, so that
the bladder dangled within a few feet of the carcass of the moose,
dancing about with the lightest breath of wind. All these precautions
Basil had taken to keep the wolves from devouring the moose&mdash;for
it was his intention to return and butcher it, as soon as he could
get help. When he had hung the bladder to his liking, he put up his
knife again; and, once more shouldering his rifle, walked off.</p>

<p>On reaching the camp&mdash;which he did shortly after&mdash;the tongue of
the moose was broiled without delay, and, after making a delicious
meal of it, the whole party went off for the remainder of the meat.
They found it all quite safe; although, had it not been for the bladder,
not much of it would have been there&mdash;as no less than a dozen great
gaunt wolves were seen lurking about, and these would have eaten it
up in the shortest possible time. The bladder, however, had kept
them off; for, strange to say, these creatures, who are as cunning as
foxes, and can hardly be trapped, can yet be deceived and frightened
by such a simple thing as a bladder dangling from a branch.</p>

<p>The moose proved to be one of the largest of his kind. His height
was quite equal to that of a horse; and his horns, flattened out to the
breadth of shovels, weighed over sixty pounds. His carcass was not
less than fifteen hundred pounds weight; and our voyageurs had to
make two journeys to convey the meat to their camp. On the last
journey, Fran&ccedil;ois brought the porcupine as well&mdash;having found it on
the very same tree where Basil had left it!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<div class="cap">LIFE IN A LOG-HUT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he log-hut was finished on the 1st of September, and not a day too
soon; for on that very day the winter set in with full severity. A
heavy fall of snow came down in the night; and next morning, when
our voyageurs looked abroad, the ground was covered to the depth of
a foot, or more; and the ice upon the lake was also white. Walking
through the great wreaths now became very difficult; and the next
thing to be done was the making of &ldquo;snow-shoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snow-shoes are an invention of the Indians; and, in the winter of
the Arctic regions of America, are an article almost as indispensable
as clothing itself. Without them, travelling afoot would be impossible.
In these countries, as already stated, the snow often covers
the ground to the depth of many feet; and remains without any considerable
diminution for six, and, in some years, eight or nine months.
At times, it is frozen hard enough on the surface to bear a man without
the snow-shoes; but oftener on account of thaws and fresh falls,
it becomes quite soft, and at such times travelling over it is both
difficult and dangerous. To avoid both the difficulty and the danger,
the Indians make use of this very singular sort of foot-wear&mdash;called
&ldquo;snow-shoes&rdquo; by the English, and &ldquo;raquets&rdquo; by the Canadian
voyageurs.</p>

<p>They are used by all the Indian tribes of the Hudson's Bay
territory; and were it not for them these people would be confined
to one place for months together, and could not follow the deer or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
other game. As almost all savages are improvident, and none more
so than the North American Indians, were they prevented for a
season from going out to hunt, whole tribes would starve. Indeed,
many individuals of them perish with hunger as it is; and the life of
all these Indians is nothing more than one continued struggle for
food enough to sustain them. In summer they are often in the
midst of plenty; slaughtering deer and buffalo by hundreds, taking
out only the tongues, and recklessly leaving the flesh to the wolves!
In winter the very same Indians may be seen without a pound of
meat in their encampment&mdash;the lives of themselves and their families
depending upon the success of a single day's hunt!</p>

<p>But let us return to the snow-shoes. Let us see what they are, and
learn how they are made.</p>

<p>Any boy who has snared sparrows in snow-time, has, no doubt,
done so by tying his snares upon a hoop netted across with twine or
other small cord. Now, if he will conceive his hoop bent into an
oblong shape&mdash;something like what the figure of a boat turned on its
mouth would make in snow&mdash;and if he will also fancy the netting to
consist of thongs of twisted deer-hide woven somewhat closely together,
he will get a very good idea of an Indian snow-shoe. It is
usually from three to four feet long, by about a foot wide at the
middle part, from which it tapers gently to a point, both at the heel
and toe.</p>

<p>The frame, as I have said, is like the hoop of a boy's bird-snare. It
is made of light, tough wood, and, of course, carefully bent and
polished with the knife. The slender branches of the &ldquo;scrub-pine&rdquo;
are esteemed excellent for this purpose, as their wood is light, flexible
and tough in its fibres. This is also a favourite tree, where it grows,
to make tent-poles, canoe-timbers, and other implements required by
the Indians; and these people use so much of it for their arrows, that
it has received from the Canadian voyageurs the name of <i>bois de
fl&ecirc;che</i> (arrow-wood).</p>

<p>Well, then, the frame of the snow-shoes being bent to its proper
shape, two transverse bars are placed across near the middle, and
several inches from each other. They are for the foot to rest upon,
as well as to give strength to the whole structure. These being made
fast, the netting is woven on, and extends over the whole frame,
with the exception of a little space in front of the bars where the ball
of the foot is to rest. This space is left free of netting, in order to
allow play to the toes while walking. The mesh-work is made of
thongs usually cut from the parchment-skin of a deer, and twisted.
Sometimes twisted intestines are used, and the netting exactly
resembles that seen in &ldquo;racquets&rdquo; for ball play.</p>

<p>The snow-shoe, when finished, is simply fastened upon the foot by
means of straps or thongs; and a pair of them thus placed, will present
a surface to the snow of nearly six square feet&mdash;more, if required,
by making them larger. But this is enough to sustain the heaviest
man upon the softest snow, and an Indian thus &ldquo;shod&rdquo; will skim
over the surface like a skater.</p>

<p>The shoes used by all tribes of Indians are not alike in shape.
There are fashions and fancies in this respect. Some are made&mdash;as
among the Chippewa Indians&mdash;with one side of the frame nearly
straight; and these, of course, will not do for either foot, but are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
&ldquo;rights and lefts.&rdquo; Generally, however, the shape is such that the
snow-shoe will fit either foot.</p>

<p>The snow-shoes having now become a necessary thing, our young
voyageurs set about making a complete set for the whole party&mdash;that
is, no less than four pairs. Norman was the &ldquo;shoemaker,&rdquo; and
Norman knew how. He could splice the frames, and work in the
netting, equal to an Indian squaw. Of course all the others assisted
him. Lucien cut the moose-skin into fine regular strips; Basil
waded off through the snow, and procured the frames from the wood
of the scrub-pine trees where he had encountered the porcupine;
and then he and Fran&ccedil;ois trimmed them with their knives, and
sweated them in the hot ashes until they became dry, and ready
for the hands of the &ldquo;shoemaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This work occupied them several days, and then each had a pair
of shoes fitted to his size and weight.</p>

<p>The next consideration was, to lay in a stock of meat. The moose
had furnished them with enough for present use, but that would not
last long, as there was no bread nor anything else to eat with it.
Persons in their situation require a great deal of meat to sustain
them, much more than those who live in great cities, who eat a
variety of substances, and drink many kinds of drinks. The healthy
voyageur is rarely without a keen appetite; and meat by itself is
a food that speedily digests, and makes way for a fresh meal; so
that the ration usually allowed to the <i>employ&eacute;s</i> of the fur companies
would appear large enough to supply the table of several families.
For instance, in some parts of the Hudson's Bay territory, the
voyageur is allowed eight pounds of buffalo-meat <i>per diem</i>! And
yet it is all eaten by him, and sometimes deemed barely sufficient.</p>

<p>A single deer, therefore, or even a buffalo, lasts a party of voyageurs
for a very short time, since they have no other substance, such as
bread or vegetables, to help it out. It was necessary, then, that our
travellers should use all their diligence in laying up a stock of dried
meat, before the winter became too cold for them to hunt. There
was another consideration&mdash;their clothing. They all had clothing
sufficient for such weather as they had yet experienced; but that
would never do for the winter of the Great Slave Lake, and they
knew it. Many deer must be killed, and many hides dressed, before
they could make a full set of clothing for all, as well as a set of
deer-skin blankets, which would be much needed.</p>

<p>As soon as the snow-shoes were finished, therefore, Basil and
Norman went out each day upon long hunting expeditions, from
which they rarely returned before nightfall. Sometimes they brought
with them a deer, of the caribou or reindeer species, and the &ldquo;woodland&rdquo;
variety, which were in plenty at this place. They only carried to
camp the best parts with the skin, as the flesh of the woodland caribou
is not much esteemed. It is larger than the other kind&mdash;the &ldquo;Barren
Ground caribou,&rdquo; weighing about one hundred and fifty pounds; but
both its venison and hide are of inferior quality to those of the latter
species. Sometimes our hunters killed smaller game; and on several
occasions they returned without having emptied their guns at all.</p>

<p>But there was one day that made up for several&mdash;one grand day
when they were extremely successful, and on which they killed
a whole herd of moose, consisting of five individuals&mdash;the old bull,
a spike buck&mdash;that is, a young buck, whose horns had not yet got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
antlers upon them&mdash;the cow, and two calves. These they had tracked
and followed for a long distance, and had succeeded, at length, in
running them into a valley where the snow was exceedingly deep, and
where the moose became entangled. There had been a shower of
rain the day before that had melted the surface of the snow; and
this had again frozen into an icy crust, upon which the deer lacerated
their ankles at every plunge, leaving a track of blood behind them as
they ran.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances they were easily trailed, and Basil and
Norman, skimming along upon their snow-shoes, soon came up with
them, and shot first one and then another, until the whole herd were
stretched in the valley. They then butchered them, and hung the
hides and quarters upon high branches, so as to secure them from
wolves and wolverenes. When the job was finished, the whole place
looked like a great slaughter-yard! Next day a rude sledge was
constructed; and the voyageurs, returning in full force, transported
the meat to camp. Huge fires were kindled outside the hut, and
several days were spent in cutting up and drying the flesh. Had our
travellers been certain that the frost would have continued all winter,
this would not have been necessary&mdash;since the meat was already
frozen as hard as a brick.</p>

<p>But they knew that a sudden thaw would spoil it; and, as there
was plenty of good firewood on the spot, they were not going to run
the risk of losing it in that way.</p>

<p>They had now enough provision to last them for months; and
hunting became no longer necessary, except to obtain fresh meat&mdash;which
was, of course, preferable to the dry stock. Hunting, also,
gave them exercise and amusement&mdash;both of which were necessary
to their health; for to remain idle and inactive in a situation
such as that in which they were placed is the worst possible plan,
and is sure to engender both sickness and <i>ennui</i>. Indeed, the last
grew upon them, notwithstanding all the pains they took to prevent
it. There were days on which the cold was so extreme, that they
could not put their noses out of the door without the danger of
having them frost-bitten&mdash;although each had now a complete suit
of deer-skin clothing, made by Lucien, the &ldquo;tailor&rdquo; of the party.</p>

<p>Upon such days they were fain to remain shut up in their hut;
and, seated around their huge log-fire, they passed the time in
cleaning their guns, mending their nets, stitching their clothes, and
such-like employments. These days were far from being their
dullest; for, what with the varied and scientific knowledge of
Lucien, which he took pleasure in imparting to his companions&mdash;what
with the practical experience of Norman amid scenes of Arctic
life, and the many &ldquo;voyageur tales&rdquo; he could tell&mdash;what with
Fran&ccedil;ois merry jokes and <i>bon mots</i>&mdash;and what with Basil's <i>talent for
listening</i>&mdash;not the least important element in a good <i>conversazione</i>,&mdash;our
<i>quartette</i> of young voyageurs found their indoor days anything
but dull.</p>

<p>This was all well enough for a while. For a month or two they
bore their odd kind of life cheerfully enough; but the prospect of
nearly six months more of it began to appal them, when they reflected
upon it; and they soon found themselves longing for a change.
Hunting adventures, that at other times would have interested them,
now occurred without creating any excitement; and the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
routine of their employments seemed monotonous. Nearly all of
them were boys of an active character of mind; and most of them
were old enough to reason about the value of time. Their idea of
such a long isolation from civilized life, and, above all, the being
debarred from following any useful pursuit, began to impress some
of them forcibly. Others, as Fran&ccedil;ois, could not be contented for
a very great stretch of time with any sort of life; so that all of them
began to sigh for a change.</p>

<p>One day, while conversing upon this theme, a bold proposal was
made by Basil. It was, that they should &ldquo;strike camp,&rdquo; and continue
their journey. This proposal took the others by surprise, but they
were all just in the frame of mind to entertain and discuss it; and
a long consultation was held upon the point. Fran&ccedil;ois chimed in
with the proposal at once; while Lucien, more cautious, did not
exactly oppose, but rather offered the reasons that were against it,
and pointed out the perils of the undertaking. Norman, of course,
was appealed to&mdash;all of them looking to him as one whose advice,
upon that question at least, was more valuable than their own.</p>

<p>Norman admitted the dangers pointed out by Lucien, but believed
that they might overcome them by a proper caution. On the whole,
Norman approved of the plan, and it was at length adopted. Perhaps
Norman's habitual prudence was to some extent influenced on this
occasion by the very natural desire he had of returning to what he
considered his home. He had now been absent nearly two years, and
was desirous of once more seeing his father and his old companions
at the Fort.</p>

<p>There was another feeling that influenced nearly all of them: that
was <i>ambition</i>. They knew that to make such a journey would be
something of a feat, and they wished to have the credit of performing
it. To minds like that of Basil, even the danger had something
attractive in it. It was resolved then to break up the encampment,
and continue their journey.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<div class="cap">TRAVELLING ON SNOW-SHOES.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>nce their resolution was taken, they lost but little time in making
preparations to carry it out. Most of the articles required for such
a journey were already in their hands. They had the proper dresses&mdash;snow-shoes,
skin-blankets, and gloves. They had prepared for themselves
sets of &ldquo;snow spectacles.&rdquo; These were made out of red cedar-wood.
Each pair consisted of two small thin pieces, that covered the
eyes, joined together and fastened on by thongs of buckskin. In
each piece an oblong slit served for the eye-hole, through which the
eye looked without being dazzled by the snow. Without this, or
some like contrivance, travelling in the Arctic regions is painful to
the eyes, and the traveller often loses his sight. Indeed, one of the
most common infirmities of both the Indians and Esquimaux of these
parts is blindness or soreness of the eyes, caused by the reflexion of
the sunbeams from the crystals of the frozen snow. Norman was
aware of this, and had made the spectacles to guard against this
peril.</p>

<p>Out of their spare skins they had made a small tent. This was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
be carried along by Marengo in a light sledge, which they had long
since constructed, and taught the dog to draw. Nothing else remained
but to pack their provisions in the smallest bulk possible,
and this was done, according to the custom of the country, by making
&ldquo;pemmican.&rdquo; The dry meat was first pounded until it became a
powder; it was then put into small skin bags, made for the purpose,
and the hot melted fat was poured in and well mixed with it. This
soon froze hard, and the mixture&mdash;that resembled &ldquo;potted meat,&rdquo;&mdash;was
now ready for use, and would keep for an indefinite time without
the least danger of spoiling. Buffalo-beef, moose-meat, or venison of
any sort, thus prepared, is called &ldquo;<i>pemmican</i>,&rdquo; and is more portable
in this shape than any other. Besides no further cooking is required&mdash;an
important consideration upon those vast prairie deserts, where
firewood is seldom to be procured without the trouble of carrying it
a great distance.</p>

<p>Norman, who was the maker of the pemmican, had produced a
superior article upon this occasion. Besides the pounded meat and
fat, he had mixed another ingredient with it, which rendered it a
most delicious food. This third ingredient was a small purple-coloured
berry&mdash;of which we have already spoken&mdash;not unlike the whortleberry,
but sweeter and of a higher flavour. It grows through most
of the Northern regions of America; and in some places, as upon the
Red River and the Elk, the bushes that produce it are seen in great
plenty.</p>

<p>Previous to the setting in of winter, our voyageurs had collected a
large bagful upon the banks of the Elk, which they had dried and
stored away&mdash;expecting to stand in need of them for this very
purpose. They now came into use, and enabled Norman to make his
pemmican of the very choicest quality. Five bags of it were put up,
each weighing over thirty pounds. One of these was to be drawn
upon the sledge, along with the tent, the axe, and a few other articles.
The rest were to be carried by the voyageurs themselves&mdash;each
shouldering one, which, along with their guns and accoutrements,
would be load enough.</p>

<p>These arrangements being at length complete, the party bid adieu
to their log-hut&mdash;gave a parting look to their little canoe, which still
rested by the door&mdash;and then, shouldering their guns and bags of
pemmican, set out over the frozen surface of the snow.</p>

<p>Of course before starting they had decided upon the route they
were to take. This decision, however, had not been arrived at until
after much discussion. Lucien advised that they should follow the
shore of the lake until they should reach the Mackenzie River&mdash;which
of course was now frozen up. Its channel, he argued, would then
guide them; and, in case their provisions should run short, they
would be more likely to find game upon its banks than elsewhere, as
these were wooded almost to the sea&mdash;in consequence of its head-waters
rising in southern latitudes, and carrying with them a warmer
climate.</p>

<p>There was plausibility in Lucien's argument, combined with much
prudence. Norman, however, advised a contrary course. He said
that they would have to make a considerable journey westward before
reaching the place where the Mackenzie River flows out of the lake;
and, moreover, he knew that the river itself was very crooked&mdash;in
some places winding about in great curves, whose ends come near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
meeting each other. Should they keep the course of the river,
Norman believed it would almost double their journey. A much
shorter route, he said, would be obtained by striking across the
country in a north-westerly direction, so as to reach the Mackenzie
near where another great stream&mdash;the River of the Mountains&mdash;empties
into it from the west. This would certainly be a more
direct route, and they would avoid the windings of the river
channel.</p>

<p>Norman's reasoning prevailed. Basil and Fran&ccedil;ois readily agreed
to his plan, and Lucien at length also gave his assent, but with some
reluctance. Norman knew nothing whatever of the route he was
advising them to take. His former journeys up and down the
Mackenzie had been made in summer, and of course he had travelled
by canoe, in company with the traders and voyageurs. He only knew
that to strike across the country would be the shorter way. But
&ldquo;the shortest way is not always the nearest,&rdquo; says the proverb; and
although Lucien remembered this prudent maxim, the others did not
give it a thought. Before the end of their journey they received a
practical lesson of its wisdom&mdash;a lesson they were not likely to forget.
But they knew not what was before them, and they started off in
high spirits.</p>

<p>Their first three or four days' journeys were without any event
worth being chronicled. They travelled full twenty miles each day.
The Southerners had become quite skilful in the management of their
snow-shoes, and they skimmed along upon the icy crust at the rate of
three or four miles an hour.</p>

<p>Marengo and his sledge gave them very little trouble. There was
full sixty pounds weight upon it; but to the huge dog this was a
mere bagatelle, and he pulled it after him without any great strain.
His harness was neatly made of moose-skin, and consisted of a collar
with a back strap and traces&mdash;the traces meeting behind, where they
were attached to the head of the sledge. No head-gear was necessary,
as Marengo needed not to be either led or driven. The sledge consisted
of two or three light planks of smooth wood, laid alongside
each other, and held together by transverse bands. In front it
turned up with a circular sweep, so as not to &ldquo;plough&rdquo; the snow;
and at the top of this curved part the traces were adjusted. The
load was, of course, carefully packed and tied, so that the overturning
of the vehicle did no damage whatever, and it could be easily righted
again. Marengo required no one to guide him, but followed quietly
in the tracks of the snow-shoes, and thus avoided the trees, rocks,
and other inequalities. If a rabbit or other creature started up,
Marengo knew better than to go galloping after it; he felt that he
had a more important duty to perform than to throw away his time
upon rabbit-hunting.</p>

<p>Each night a spot was chosen for the camp by the side of some lake
or stream, where wood could be obtained for their fire. Water was
got by breaking a hole in the ice, and the little tent was always set
up in a sheltered situation.</p>

<p>Upon the fifth day after leaving the log-hut the woods began to
grown thinner and more straggling; and towards night of the same
day they found themselves travelling through a country, where the
timber only grew here and there in small clumps, and the individual
trees were small and stunted. Next day still less timber was seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
upon their route; and when camping-time came, they were obliged
to halt at a spot where nothing but willows could be procured for
their fire. They had, in fact, arrived upon the edge of that vast
wilderness, the Barren Grounds, which stretches in all its wild desolation
along the Northern half of the American continent from the
Great Slave Lake even to the shores of the Arctic Sea on the north,
and to those of Hudson's Bay on the east.</p>

<p>This territory bears an appropriate name, for, perhaps, upon the
whole surface of the earth there is no tract more barren or desolate&mdash;not
even the Sa&auml;ra of Africa. Both are deserts of immense extent,
equally difficult to cross, and equally dangerous to the traveller. On
both the traveller often perishes, but from different causes. On the
Sa&auml;ra it is <i>thirst</i> that kills; upon the Barren Grounds <i>hunger</i> is more
frequently the destroyer. In the latter there is but little to be feared
on the score of water. That exists in great plenty; or where it is not
found, snow supplies its place. But there is water everywhere. Hill
succeeds hill, bleak, rocky, and bare. Everywhere granite, gneiss, or
other primitive rocks, show themselves.</p>

<p>No vegetation covers the steep declivities of the hills, except the
moss and lichen upon the rocks, a few willows upon the banks of
streams, the dwarf birch-tree or the scrub-pines, rising only to the
height of a few inches, and often straggling over the earth like vines.
Every hill has its valley, and every valley its lake&mdash;dark, and deep,
and silent&mdash;in winter scarce to be distinguished under the snow-covered
ice. The prospect in every direction exhibits a surface of
rocks, or bleak hills, half covered with snow. The traveller looks
around and sees no life. He listens and hears no sound. The world
appears dead and wrapped in its cold winding-sheet!</p>

<p>Amidst just such scenes did our voyageurs find themselves on the
seventh day after parting from the lake. They had heard of the
Barren Grounds&mdash;had heard many fearful stories of the sufferings of
travellers who had attempted to cross them; but the description had
fallen far short of the actual reality. None of them could believe in
the difficulties to be encountered, and the desolateness of the scene
they were to witness, until now that they found themselves in its
midst; and, as they proceeded on their journey, getting farther and
farther from the wooded region, their apprehensions, already aroused
by the wild aspect of the country, grew stronger and stronger. They
began to entertain serious fears, for they knew not how far the barren
tract extended along their route.</p>

<p>On calculation they found they had provisions enough to last them
for a month. That in some measure restored their confidence; but
even then, they could not help giving way to serious reflections.
Should they get lost or retarded in their course by mountains, or
other obstacles, it might take them longer than a month to reach
some place where game was to be met with. Each day, as they advanced,
they found the country more hilly and difficult. Precipices
often bounded the valleys, lying directly across their track; and as
these could not be scaled, it was necessary to make long <i>d&eacute;tours</i> to
pass them, so that some days they actually advanced less than five
miles upon their journey.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these impediments, they might still have got over
the Barren Grounds without further suffering than the fatigue and
necessary exposure to cold; but at this time an incident occurred, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
not only frustrated all their calculations, but placed them in imminent
danger of perishing.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<div class="cap">THE BARREN GROUNDS</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he Barren Grounds are not entirely destitute of animal life. Even
in winter&mdash;when they are almost covered with snow, and you would
suppose that no living creature could procure subsistence upon them&mdash;even
then they have their denizens; and, strange to say, there are
many animals that choose them for their home. There is no part of
the earth's surface so sterile but that some animated being can find a
living upon it, and such a being Nature adapts to its peculiar situation.
For instance, there are animals that prefer the very desert
itself, and would not thrive were you to place them in a country of
mild climate and fertile soil. In our own species this peculiarity is
also found&mdash;as the Esquimaux would not be happy were you to transplant
him from his icy hut amid the snows of the Arctic regions, and
give him a palace under the genial skies of Italy.</p>

<p>Among other creatures that remain all winter upon the Barren
Grounds are the wolves. How they exist there is almost a question
of the naturalists. It is true they prey upon other animals found at
times in the same district; but wolves have been met with where not
the slightest traces of other living creatures could be seen!</p>

<p>There is no animal more generally distributed over the earth's
surface than the wolf. He exists in nearly every country, and most
likely has at one time existed in all. In America there are wolves in
its three zones. They are met with from Cape Horn to the farthest
point northward that man has reached. They are common in the
tropical forests of Mexico and South America. They range over the
great prairies of the temperate zones of both divisions of the continent,
and in the colder regions of the Hudson's Bay territory they are
among the best known of wild animals. They frequent the mountains,
they gallop over the plains, they skulk through the valleys,
they dwell everywhere&mdash;everywhere the wolf seems equally at home.</p>

<p>In North America two very different kinds are known. One is the
&ldquo;prairie&rdquo; or &ldquo;barking&rdquo; wolf, which we have already met with and
described. The other species is the &ldquo;common&rdquo; or &ldquo;large&rdquo; wolf; but
it is not decided among naturalists that there are not several distinct
species of the latter. At all events, there are several <i>varieties</i> of it&mdash;distinguished
from each other in size, colour, and even to some extent
in form. The habits of all, however, appear to be similar, and it is a
question, whether any of these varieties be <i>permanent</i> or only <i>accidental</i>.
Some of them, it is well known, are accidental&mdash;as wolves
differing in colour have been found in the same litter&mdash;but late explorers,
of the countries around and beyond the Rocky Mountains,
have discovered one or two kinds that appear to be specifically distinct
from the common wolf of America&mdash;one of them, the &ldquo;dusky
wolf,&rdquo; being much larger.</p>

<p>This last is said to resemble the wolf of Europe more than the other
American wolves do&mdash;for there is a considerable difference between
the wolves of the two continents. Those of the Northern regions of
America have shorter ears, a broader snout and forehead, and are of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
a stouter make, than the European wolves. Their fur, too, is finer,
denser, and longer; their tails more bushy and fox-like; and their
feet broader. The European wolf, on the contrary, is characterized
by a gaunt appearance, a pointed snout, long jaws, high ears, long
legs, and feet very narrow. It is possible, nothwithstanding these
points of difference, that both may be of the same species, the difference
arising from a want of similitude in the circumstances by which
they are surrounded.</p>

<p>For instance, the dense wool of the Hudson's Bay wolf may be
accounted for by the fact of its colder habitat, and its broader feet may
be the result of its having to run much upon the surface of the snow.
The writer of this little book believes that this peculiar adaptation
of Nature&mdash;which may be observed in all her kingdoms&mdash;may explain
the difference that exists between the wolves of the Northern parts
of America and those of the South of Europe. He believes, moreover,
that those of the Southern parts of the American continent approximate
more nearly to the Pyrenean wolves, as he has seen in the
tropical forest of Mexico some that possessed all that &ldquo;gaunt&rdquo; form
and &ldquo;sneaking&rdquo; aspect that characterize the latter.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to inquire whether the wolves of Siberia
and Lapland, inhabitating a similar climate to that of the Northern
parts of America, do not possess the same peculiarities as the North
American kind&mdash;a point which naturalists have not yet considered,
and which you, my boy reader, may some day find both amusement
and instruction in determining for yourself.</p>

<p>With regard to colour the wolves of both continents exhibit many
varieties. In North America there are more than half-a-dozen colours
of them, all receiving different names. There is the &ldquo;grey wolf,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;white,&rdquo; the &ldquo;brown,&rdquo; the &ldquo;dusky,&rdquo; the &ldquo;pied,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;black.&rdquo;
These trivial names will give a good enough idea of the colours of
each kind, but there are even varieties in their markings. &ldquo;Yellow&rdquo;
wolves, too, have been seen, and &ldquo;red&rdquo; ones, and some of a &ldquo;cream
colour.&rdquo; Of all these the grey wolf is the most common, and is <i>par
excellence the wolf</i>; but there are districts in which individuals of
other colours predominate. Wolves purely black are plenty in many
parts, and white wolves are often seen in large packs.</p>

<p>Even those of the same colour differ in size, and that to a considerable
extent. And what is also strange, large wolves will be found in
one district of country, while much smaller ones <i>of the same colour and
species</i> inhabit another. The largest in size of American wolves are
about six feet in length, the tail included; and about three feet in
height, measuring to the tips of the standing fur. The tail is usually
about one-third of the whole length.</p>

<p>The habits of the American wolf are pretty much like those of his
European cousin. He is a beast of prey, devouring all the smaller
animals he can lay hold of. He pursues and overtakes the deer, and
often runs down the fox and makes a meal of it. He will kill and eat
Indian dogs, although these are so near his own species that the one
is often taken for the other. But this is not all, for he will even eat
his own kind, on a pinch. He is as cunning as the fox himself, and as
cowardly; but at times, when impelled by hunger, he becomes bolder,
and has been known to attack man. Instances of this kind, however,
are rare.</p>

<p>The American wolves burrow, and, like the fox, have several entrances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to their holes. A litter of young wolves numbers five puppies,
but as many as eight are often produced at one birth.</p>

<p>During their journey through the Barren Grounds our voyageurs
had frequently observed wolves. They were mostly grey ones, and
of great size, for they were travelling through a district where the
very largest kind is found. At times they saw a party of five or six
together; and these appeared to be following upon their trail&mdash;as
each night, when they came barking about the camp, our travellers
recognised some of them as having been seen before. They made no
attempt to shoot any of them&mdash;partly because they did not want
either their skins or flesh, and partly because their ammunition had
been reduced to a small quantity, and they did not wish to spend it
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>The wolves, therefore, were allowed to approach very near the
camp, and howl as much as they liked&mdash;which they usually did
throughout the livelong night. What they found to allure them
after our travellers, the latter could not make out; as they had not
shot an animal of any kind since leaving the lake, and scarcely a
scrap of anything was ever left behind them. Perhaps the wolves
were <i>living upon hope</i>.</p>

<p>One evening our travellers had made their camp on the side of a
ridge&mdash;which they had just crossed&mdash;and under the shelter of some
rough rocks. There was no wood in the neighbourhood wherewith
to make a fire; but they had scraped the snow from the place over
which their tent was pitched, and under it their skins were spread
upon the ground. As the tent was a very small one, Marengo's
sledge, with the utensils and pemmican bags, was always left outside
close by the opening. Marengo himself slept there, and that was
considered sufficient to secure all these things from wolves, or any
other creatures that might be prowling about.</p>

<p>On the evening in question, the sledge was in its usual place&mdash;the
dog having been taken from it&mdash;and as our voyageurs had not yet
had their supper, the pemmican bags were lying loosely about, one
or two of them being open. There was a small rivulet at the foot of
the ridge&mdash;some two hundred paces distant&mdash;and Basil and Fran&ccedil;ois
had gone down to it to get water. One of them took the axe to
break the ice with, while the other carried a vessel. On arriving
near the bank of the rivulet, the attention of the boys was attracted
to a singular appearance upon the snow. A fresh shower had fallen
that morning, and the surface was still soft, and very smooth. Upon
this they observed double lines of little dots, running in different
directions, which, upon close inspection, appeared to be the tracks of
some animal.</p>

<p>At first, Basil and Fran&ccedil;ois could hardly believe them to be such,
the tracks were so very small. They had never seen so small ones
before&mdash;those of a mouse being quite double the size. But when they
looked more closely at them, the boys could distinguish the marks of
five little toes with claws upon them, which left no doubt upon their
minds that some living creature, and that a very diminutive one,
must have passed over the spot. Indeed, had the snow not been
both fine-grained and soft, the feet of such a creature could not have
made any impression upon it.</p>

<p>The boys stopped and looked around, thinking they might see the
animal itself. There was a wide circle of snow around them, and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
surface was smooth and level; but not a speck upon it betrayed the
presence of any creature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was a bird,&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;and has taken flight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; rejoined Basil. &ldquo;They are not the tracks of a bird.
It is some animal that has gone under the snow, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I see no hole,&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;where even a beetle could have
gone down. Let us look for one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Fran&ccedil;ois' suggestion, they walked on following one of the dotted
lines. Presently they came to a place, where a stalk of long grass
stood up through the snow&mdash;its seedless panicle just appearing above
the surface. Round this stalk a little hole had been formed&mdash;partly
by the melting of the snow, and partly by the action of the wind
upon the panicle&mdash;and into this hole the tracks led. It was evident
that the animal, whatever it was, must have gone down the culm of
the grass in making its descent from the surface of the snow!</p>

<p>They now observed another track going <i>from</i> the hole in an opposite
direction, which showed that the creature had climbed up in
the same way. Curious to know what it might have been, the boys
hailed Lucien and Norman, telling them to come down. These,
followed by Marengo, soon arrived upon the spot. When Lucien
saw the tracks, he pronounced them at once to be those of the little
shrew-mouse, the smallest of all the quadrupeds of America. Several
of them had evidently been out upon the snow&mdash;as there were other
dotted lines&mdash;and the tops of many stalks of grass were seen above
the surface, each of which had formed a little hole around it, by
which the mice were enabled to get up and down.</p>

<p>Norman, who had seen these little animals before, cautioned his
companions to remain quiet awhile, and perhaps some of them might
come to the surface. They all stopped therefore, and stood some
time without moving, or speaking to one another. Presently, a little
head not much bigger than a pea was seen peeping up, and then a
body followed, which in size did not exceed that of a large gooseberry!
To this a tail was suspended, just one inch in length, of a
square shape, and tapering from root to point, like that of any other
mouse. The little creature was covered with a close smooth fur, of a
clove-brown colour above, but more yellowish upon the belly and
sides; and was certainly, as it sat upon the even surface of the snow,
the most diminutive and oddest-looking quadruped that any of the
party had ever beheld.</p>

<p>They were just whispering to one another what means they should
use to capture it, when Marengo, whom Basil had been holding
quiet, all at once uttered a loud bay; and, springing out of the hands
of his master, galloped off towards the camp. All of them looked
after, wondering what had started the dog; but his strange behaviour
was at once explained, and to their consternation. Around the tent,
and close to its entrance, several large wolves were seen. They were
leaping about hurriedly, and worrying some objects that lay upon
the ground. What these objects were was too plain. They were <i>the
bags of pemmican</i>! Part of their contents was seen strewed over the
snow, and part was already in the stomachs of the wolves.</p>

<p>The boys uttered a simultaneous shout, and ran forward. Marengo
was by this time among the wolves, and had set fiercely upon one of
them. Had his masters not been at hand, the fierce brutes would
soon have settled the account with Marengo. But the former were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
now close by, and the wolves, seeing them, ran off; but, to the consternation
of the boys, each of them carried off a bag of the pemmican
in his mouth with as much lightness and speed as if nothing encumbered
them!</p>

<span class="caption">THE WOLVES AND THE PEMMICAN BAGS.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;We are lost!&rdquo; cried Norman, in a voice of terror. &ldquo;Our provisions
are gone!&mdash;all gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true. The next moment the wolves disappeared over the
summit of the ridge; and although each of the boys had seized his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
gun, and ran after, the pursuit proved an idle one. Not a wolf was
overtaken.</p>

<p>Scarce a scrap of the pemmican had been left&mdash;only some fragments
that had been gnawed by the ravenous brutes, and scattered
over the snow. That night our travellers went to bed supperless;
and, what with hunger, and the depression of spirits caused by this
incident, one and all of them kept awake nearly the whole of the
night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE ROCK-TRIPE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>hey left their skin-couch at an early hour, close after daybreak.
Hunger and anxiety drove them out of their tent. Not a morsel of
anything for breakfast! They looked abroad over the country, in
order, if possible, to descry some living creature. None could be
seen&mdash;nothing but the wilderness waste of snow, with here and there
the side of a steep hill, or a rock showing cold and bleak. Even the
wolves that had robbed them were no longer to be seen, as if these
creatures knew that they had got all that was worth having, and had
now taken themselves off to hunt for plunder elsewhere.</p>

<p>The situation of our travellers was really one of extreme peril,
although it may be difficult for you, young reader, to conceive why it
should be so. They, however, knew it well. They knew that they
might travel for days through that inhospitable region, without falling
in with anything that would make a single meal for them. But less
time than that would suffice to starve them all. Already they felt
the pangs of hunger&mdash;for they had not eaten since their breakfast of
the preceding day, the wolves having interrupted their preparations
for dinner.</p>

<p>It was of no use remaining where they were; so, striking their tent
once more, they travelled forward. It was but poor consolation to
them that they travelled much lighter than before. They had nothing
to carry but their guns, and these they had got ready for work&mdash;so
that their journey partook somewhat of the character of a hunting
excursion. They did not even follow a direct course, but occasionally
turned to one side or the other, wherever a clump of willows, or any
other roughness on the ground, looked like it might be the shelter of
game. But during that whole day&mdash;although they travelled from
near sunrise to sunset&mdash;not a living thing was seen; and for the
second night they went supperless to bed.</p>

<p>A man will bear hunger for many days&mdash;some more, some less&mdash;without
actually dying of it; but at no period will his sufferings be
greater than during the third or fourth day. He will grow more
feeble afterwards, but the pain which he endures will not be greater.</p>

<p>On the third day the sufferings of our party were extreme. They
began to chew pieces of their skin-tent and blankets; but although
this took the sharp edge off their appetites, it added nothing to their
strength; and they still craved for food, and grew feebler.</p>

<p>To use a poetical phrase, Marengo now became the &ldquo;cynosure of
every eye.&rdquo; Marengo was not very fat. The sledge and short rations
had thinned him down, and his ribs could be easily traced. Although
the boys, and Basil in particular, would have suffered much before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
sacrificing him, yet starvation will reconcile a man to part with his
best friend. In spite of their friendship for Marengo, his masters
could not help scanning him from time to time with hungry looks.
Marengo was an old dog, and, no doubt, as tough as a piece of tan-leather;
but their appetites were made up for anything.</p>

<p>It was near mid-day. They had started early, as on the day before.
They were trudging wearily along, and making but little progress.
Marengo was struggling with his sledge, feeble as any of the party.
Basil saw that the eyes of his companions were from time to time
bent upon the dog; and though none of them said anything, he
understood the thoughts that were passing within them. He knew
that none of them wished to propose it&mdash;as Basil was the real master
of Marengo&mdash;but their glances were sufficiently intelligible to him.
He looked at the downcast countenance of the once merry Fran&ccedil;ois&mdash;at
the serious air of Norman&mdash;at the wan cheek and sunken eye of
Lucien, whom Basil dearly loved. He hesitated no longer. His duty
to his companions at once overcame his affection for his faithful dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must kill <i>him</i>!&rdquo; said he, suddenly stopping, and pointing to
Marengo.</p>

<p>The rest halted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear there's no help for it,&rdquo; said Norman, turning his face in
every direction, and sweeping the surface of the snow with hopeless
glances.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois also assented to the proposal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us make a condition,&rdquo; suggested Lucien; &ldquo;I for one could
walk five miles farther.&rdquo; And as Lucien said this, he made an effort
to stand erect, and look strong and brave; but Basil knew it was an
effort of <i>generosity</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he,&mdash;&ldquo;no, dear Luce. You are done up. We must kill
the dog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Basil, you mistake,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;I assure you I
am far from being done up. I could go much farther yet. Stay!&rdquo;
continued he, pointing ahead; &ldquo;you see yonder rocks? They are
about three miles off, I should think. They lie directly in our course.
Well, now, let us agree to this condition. Let us give poor Marengo
a chance for his life. If we find nothing before reaching those rocks,
why then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Lucien, seeing Marengo gazing up in his face, left the sentence
unfinished. The poor brute looked up at all of them as though he
understood every word that they were saying; and his mute appeal,
had it been necessary, would not have been thrown away. But it did
not require that to get him the proposed respite. All agreed willingly
with Lucien's proposition; and, shouldering their pieces, the party
moved on.</p>

<p>Lucien had purposely understated the distance to the rocks. It
was five, instead of three miles; and some of them made it full ten,
as they were determined Marengo should have the benefit of every
chance. They deployed like skirmishers; and not a brake or brush
that lay to the right or left of the path but was visited and beaten
by one or other of them. Their diligence was to no purpose. After
two hours' weary work, they arrived among the rocks, having seen
not a trace of either quadruped or bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; cried Lucien in his now feeble voice, still trying to look
cheerful, &ldquo;we must pass through them. There is a chance yet. Let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
him have fair play. The rocks were to be the limit, but it was not
stated what part of them. Let us pass through to the other side&mdash;they
do not extend far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Encouraged by the words of Lucien, the party entered among the
rocks, moving on separate paths. They had gone only a few paces,
when a shout from Norman caused the rest to look to him for an
explanation. No animal was in sight. Had he seen any? No; but
something that gratified him certainly, for his voice and manner
expressed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired the others, all speaking at the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tripe de roche</i>!&rdquo; answered he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tripe de roche</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Norman, &ldquo;look there!&rdquo; and he pointed to one of the
rocks directly ahead of them, at the same time moving forward to it.
The others hastened up after. On reaching the rock, they saw what
Norman had meant by the words <i>tripe de roche</i> (rock-tripe). It was
a black, hard, crumply substance, that nearly covered the surface of
the rock, and was evidently of a vegetable nature. Lucien knew
what it was as well as Norman, and joy had expressed itself upon his
pale cheeks at the sight. As for Basil and Fran&ccedil;ois they only stood
waiting an explanation, and wondering what value a quantity of
&ldquo;rock moss,&rdquo; as they deemed it, could be to persons in their condition.</p>

<p>Lucien soon informed them that it was not a &ldquo;moss,&rdquo; but a &ldquo;lichen,&rdquo;
and of that celebrated species which will sustain human life. It was
the <i>Gyrophora</i>. Norman confirmed Lucien's statement, and furthermore
affirmed, that not only the Indians and Esquimaux, but also
parties of voyageurs, had often subsisted upon it for days, when they
would otherwise have starved. There are many species,&mdash;not less
than five or six. All of them possess nutritive properties, but only
one is a palatable food&mdash;the <i>Gyrophora vellea</i> of botanists. Unfortunately
this was not the sort which our voyageurs had happened
upon, as it grows only upon rocks shaded by woods, and is rarely met
with in the open barrens. The one, however, which Norman had
discovered was the &ldquo;next best,&rdquo; and they were all glad at finding
even that.</p>

<p>The first thing to be thought of was to collect it, and all four set to
peeling and scraping it from the rocks. The next thought was to
make it ready for eating. Here a new difficulty stared them in the
face. The <i>tripe de roche</i> had to be boiled,&mdash;it could not be eaten else,&mdash;and
where was the fire? where was the wood to make one? Not a
stick was to be seen. They had not met with a tree during all that
day's journey!</p>

<p>They were now as badly off as ever. The <i>tripe de roche</i> would be of
no more use to them than so much dry grass. What could they do
with it?</p>

<p>In the midst of their suspense, one of them thought of the sledge.&mdash;Marengo's
sledge. That would make a fire, but a very small one.
It might do to cook a single meal. Even that was better than none.
Marengo was not going to object to the arrangement. He looked
quite willing to part with the sledge. But a few hours before, it
came near being used to cook Marengo himself. He was not aware
of that, perhaps, but no matter. All agreed that the sledge must be
broken up, and converted into firewood.</p>

<p>They were about taking it to pieces, and had already &ldquo;unhitched&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Marengo from it, when Basil, who had walked to the other side of
the rocky jumble, cried back to them to desist. He had espied some
willows at no great distance. Out of these a fire could be made.
The sledge, therefore, was let alone for the present. Basil and Fran&ccedil;ois
immediately started for the willows, while Norman and Lucien
remained upon the spot to prepare the &ldquo;tripe&rdquo; for the pot.</p>

<p>In a short time the former parties returned with two large bundles
of willows, and the fire was kindled. The <i>tripe de roche</i>, with some
snow&mdash;for there was no water near&mdash;was put into the pot, and the
latter hung over the blaze.</p>

<p>After boiling for nearly an hour, the lichen became reduced to
a soft gummy pulp, and Norman thickened the mess to his taste by
putting in more snow, or more of the &ldquo;tripe,&rdquo; as it seemed to require
it. The pot was then taken from the fire, and all four greedily ate
of its contents. It was far from being palatable, and had a clammy
&ldquo;feel&rdquo; in the mouth, something like sago; but none of the party was
in any way either dainty or fastidious just at that time, and they
soon consumed all that had been cooked. It did not satisfy the
appetite, though it filled the stomach, and made their situation less
painful to bear.</p>

<p>Norman informed them that it was much better when cooked with
a little meat, so as to make broth. This Norman's companions could
easily credit, but where was the meat to come from? The Indians
prefer the <i>tripe de roche</i> when prepared along with the roe of fish, or
when boiled in fish liquor.</p>

<p>Our weary voyageurs resolved to remain among the rocks for that
night at least; and with this intent they put up their little tent.
They did not kindle any fire, as the willows were scarce, and there
would be barely enough to make one or two more boilings of the
rock-tripe. They spread their skins within the tent, and creeping
in, kept one another as warm as they could until morning.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE POLAR HARE AND GREAT SNOWY OWL.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>f course hunger kept them from sleeping late. They were up and
out of the tent by an early hour. Their fire was re-kindled, and they
were making preparations for a fresh pot of rock-tripe, when they
were startled by the note of a well-known bird. On looking up, they
beheld seated upon the point of a rock the creature itself, which was
the &ldquo;cinereous crow,&rdquo; or, as it is better known, the &ldquo;whiskey Jack.&rdquo;
The latter name it receives from the voyageurs, on account of the
resemblance of its Indian appellation, &ldquo;whiskae-shaw-neesh&rdquo; to the
words &ldquo;whiskey John.&rdquo; Although sometimes called the &ldquo;cinereous
crow,&rdquo; the bird is a true jay.</p>

<p>It is one of the most inelegant of the genus, being of a dull grey
colour, and not particularly graceful in its form. Its plumage,
moreover, does not consist of webbed feathers, but rather more
resembles hair; nor does its voice make up for the plainness of its
appearance, as is the case with some birds. On the contrary, the
voice of &ldquo;whiskey Jack&rdquo; is plaintive and squeaking, though he is
something of a mocker in his way, and frequently imitates the notes
of other birds. He is one of those creatures that frequent the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
habitations of man, and there is not a fur post, or fort, in all the
Hudson's Bay territory, where &ldquo;whiskey Jack&rdquo; is not familiarly
known.</p>

<p>He is far from being a favourite, however, as, like his near relative
the magpie, he is a great thief, and will follow the marten-trapper all
day while baiting his traps, perching upon a tree until the bait is
set, and then pouncing down, and carrying it off. He frequently
pilfers small articles from the forts and encampments, and is so bold
as to enter the tents, and seize food out of any vessel that may
contain it. Notwithstanding all this, he is a favourite with the
traveller through these inhospitable regions. No matter how barren
the spot where the voyageur may make his camp, his tent will
hardly be pitched, before he receives a visit from &ldquo;whiskey Jack,&rdquo;
who comes, of course, to pick up any crumbs that may fall. His
company, therefore, in a region where all other wild creatures shun
the society of man, endears him to the lonely traveller.</p>

<p>At many of their camps our voyageurs had met with this singular
bird, and were always glad to receive him as a friend. They were
now doubly delighted to see him, but this delight arose from no
friendly feelings. Their guest was at once doomed to die. Fran&ccedil;ois
had taken up his gun, and in the next moment would have brought
him down, had he not been checked by Norman. Not that Norman
intended to plead for his life, but Norman's eye had caught sight of
another &ldquo;whiskey Jack,&rdquo;&mdash;which was hopping among the rocks at
some distance&mdash;and fearing that Fran&ccedil;ois' shot might frighten it
away, had hindered him from firing. It was Norman's design to get
both.</p>

<p>The second &ldquo;whiskey Jack,&rdquo; or, perhaps, it was the &ldquo;whiskey Jill,&rdquo;
soon drew near; and both were now seen to hop from rock to rock,
and then upon the top of the tent, and one of them actually settled
upon the edge of the pot, as it hung over the fire, and quietly looking
into it, appeared to scrutinize its contents!</p>

<p>The boys could not think of any way of getting the birds, except
by Fran&ccedil;ois' gun; and it was at length agreed that Fran&ccedil;ois should
do his best. He was sure of one of them, at least; so telling the
others to get behind him, he fired at the more distant one where it
sat upon the tent, and took the other on the wing.</p>

<p>Both shots were successful. The two jays fell, and were soon
divested of their soft, silky, hair-like plumage, and dropped into the
boiling pot. They did not weigh together more than about six or
seven ounces; but even that was accounted something under present
circumstances; and, with the <i>tripe de roche</i>, a much better breakfast
was made than they had anticipated.</p>

<p>No more of the lichen could be found. The rocks were all searched,
but only a few patches&mdash;not enough for another full meal&mdash;could
be obtained. The travellers had no other resource, therefore, but
to continue on, and passing through the rocky ground, they once
more embarked upon the wilderness of snow.</p>

<p>During that whole day not a living creature gladdened their eyes.
They saw nothing that was eatable&mdash;fish, flesh, fowl, or vegetable.
Not even a bit of rock-tripe&mdash;in these parts the last resource of
starving men&mdash;could be met with. They encamped in a plain, where
not a tree stood&mdash;not even a rock to shelter them.</p>

<p>Next morning a consultation was held. Marengo was again the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
subject of their thoughts and conversation. Should they kill him on
the spot or go a little farther? That was the question. Lucien,
as before, interposed in his favour. There was a high hill many
miles off, and in their proper course. &ldquo;Let us first reach yonder
hill,&rdquo; proposed Lucien. &ldquo;If nothing is found before that, then we
must part with Marengo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The proposal was agreed to, and, striking their tent, they again
set out.</p>

<p>It was a toilsome long way to that hill&mdash;feeble and weary as they
all were&mdash;but they reached it without having observed the slightest
trace of animal life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up the hill!&rdquo; cried Lucien, beckoning to the others, and cheering
them with his weak voice, &ldquo;Up the hill!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On they went, up the steep declivity&mdash;Marengo toiling on after
them. The dog looked downcast and despairing. He really appeared
to know the conditions that had been made for his life. His
masters, as they crept upward, looked sharply before them. Every
tuft that appeared above the snow was scrutinized, and every inch of
the ground, as it came into view, was examined.</p>

<p>At length they crossed the escarpment of the hill, and stood upon
the summit. They gazed forward with disappointed feelings. The
hill-top was a sort of table plain, of about three hundred yards in
diameter. It was covered with snow, nearly a foot in depth. A few
heads of withered grass were seen above the surface, but not enough
to subdue the uniform white that prevailed all over. There was no
creature upon it; that was evident. A bird as big as a sparrow, or a
quadruped as large as a shrew-mouse, could have been seen upon any
part of it. A single glance satisfied all of them that no living thing
was there.</p>

<p>They halted without proceeding farther. Some of them could not
have gone another mile, and all of them were tottering in their tracks.
Marengo had arrived upon the summit, and stood a little to one side,
with the sledge behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> must do it!&rdquo; said Basil, speaking to Norman in a hoarse
voice, and turning his head away. Lucien and Fran&ccedil;ois stepped
aside at the same time, and stood as if looking down the hill. The
countenances of all three betokened extreme sorrow. There was a
tear in Basil's eye that he was trying to wipe away with his sleeve.</p>

<p>The sharp click of Norman's gun was heard behind them, and they
were all waiting for the report, when, at that moment, a dark shadow
passing over the white declivity arrested their attention! It was
the shadow of a bird upon the wing. The simultaneous exclamation
of all three stayed Norman's finger&mdash;already pressing upon the trigger&mdash;and
the latter, turning round, saw that they were regarding some
object in the air. It was a bird of great size&mdash;almost as large as an
eagle, but with the plumage of a swan. It was white all over&mdash;both
body and wings&mdash;white as the snow over which it was sailing.
Norman knew the bird at a glance. Its thick short neck and large
head&mdash;its broad-spreading wings, of milky whiteness, were not to be
mistaken. It was the &ldquo;great snowy owl&rdquo; of the Arctic regions.</p>

<p>Its appearance suddenly changed the aspect of affairs. Norman
let the butt of his rifle fall to the ground, and stood, like the rest,
watching the bird in its flight.</p>

<p>The snowy owl is, perhaps, the most beautiful, as it is one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
most powerful birds of its genus&mdash;of which there are more than a
dozen in North America. It is a bird of the Polar regions&mdash;even the
most remote&mdash;and in the dead of winter it is found within the Arctic
circle, on both Continents&mdash;although at the same season it also
wanders farther south. It dwells upon the Barren Grounds as well
as in wooded districts. In the former it squats upon the snow, where
its peculiar colour often prevents it from being noticed by the passing
hunter. Nature has furnished it with every protection from the
cold. Its plumage is thick, closely matted, and downy, and it is
feathered to the very eyes&mdash;so that its legs appear as large as those
of a good-sized dog. The bill, too, is completely hidden under a mass
of feathers that cover its face, and not even a point of its whole body
is exposed.</p>

<p>The owl is usually looked upon as a night-bird, and in Southern
latitudes it is rarely seen by day; but the owls of the Northern
regions differ from their congeners in this respect. They hunt by
day, even during the bright hours of noon. Were it not so, how could
they exist in the midst of an Arctic summer, when the days are
months in duration? Here we have another example of the manner
in which Nature trains her wild creatures to adapt themselves to
their situation.</p>

<p>At least a dozen species of owls frequent the territory of the
Hudson's Bay Company&mdash;the largest of which is the cinereous owl,
whose wings have a spread of nearly five feet. Some species migrate
south on the approach of winter; while several, as the snowy owl,
remain to prey upon the ptarmigan, the hares, and other small
quadrupeds, who, like themselves, choose that dreary region for their
winter home.</p>

<p>Our travellers, as I have said, stood watching the owl as it soared
silently through the heavens. Fran&ccedil;ois had thrown his gun across
his left arm, in hopes he might get a shot at it; but the bird&mdash;a shy
one at all times&mdash;kept away out of range; and, after circling once or
twice over the hill, uttered a loud cry and flew off.</p>

<p>Its cry resembled the moan of a human being in distress; and its
effect upon the minds of our travellers, in the state they then were,
was far from being pleasant. They watched the bird with despairing
looks, until it was lost against the white background of a snow-covered
hill.</p>

<p>They had noticed that the owl appeared to be just taking flight
when they first saw it. It must have risen up from the hill upon
which they were; and they once more ran their eyes along the level
summit, curious to know where it had been perched that they had
not seen it. No doubt, reflected they, it had been near enough, but
its colour had rendered it undistinguishable from the snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; exclaimed Fran&ccedil;ois.</p>

<p>While making these reflections, and sweeping their glances around,
an object caught their eyes that caused some of them to ejaculate
and suddenly raise their guns. This object was near the centre of
the summit table, and at first sight appeared to be only a lump of
snow; but upon closer inspection, two little round spots of a dark
colour, and above these two elongated black marks, could be seen.
Looking steadily, the eye at length traced the outlines of an animal,
that sat in a crouching attitude. The round spots were its eyes, and
the black marks above them were tips of a pair of very long ears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
All the rest of its body was covered with a soft white fur, hardly to
be distinguished from the snow upon which it rested.</p>

<p>The form and colour of the animal, but more especially its long
erect ears, made it easy for them to tell what it was. All of them
saw it was a hare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; continued Norman, as soon as he saw it, &ldquo;keep still all of
you&mdash;leave it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; demanded Basil. &ldquo;Can we not assist you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the reply, uttered in a whisper, &ldquo;stay where you are.
Keep the dog quiet. I'll manage puss, if the owl hasn't scared her
too badly. That scream has started her out of her form. I'm certain
she wasn't that way before. Maybe she'll sit it out. Lucky the sun's
high&mdash;don't move a step. Have the dog ready, but hold him tight,
and keep a sharp look out if she bolts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After giving these instructions, that were all uttered quickly and
in an under tone, Norman moved off, with his gun carried across his
arm. He did not move in the direction of the hare, but rather as if
he was going <i>from</i> her. His course, however, bent gradually into a
circle of which the hare was the centre&mdash;the diameter being the full
breadth of the summit level, which was about three hundred yards.
In this circle he walked round and round, keeping his eye fixed upon
the crouching animal. When he had nearly completed one circumference,
he began to shorten the diameter&mdash;so that the curve which
he was now following was a spiral one, and gradually drawing nearer
to the hare. The latter kept watching him as he moved&mdash;curiosity
evidently mingling with her fears. Fortunately, as Norman had said,
the sun was nearly in the vertex of the heavens, and his own body
cast very little shadow upon the snow. Had it been otherwise, the
hare would have been frightened at the moving shadow, and would
have sprung out of her form, before he could have got within range.</p>

<p>When he had made some four or five circuits, Norman moved slower
and slower, and then stopped nearly opposite to where the others
were. These stood watching him with beating hearts, for they knew
that the life of Marengo, and perhaps their own as well, depended on
the shot. Norman had chosen his place, so that in case the hare
bolted, she might run towards them, and give them the chance of a
flying shot. His gun was already at his shoulder&mdash;his finger rested
on the trigger, and the boys were expecting the report, when again
the shadow of a bird flitted over the snow, a loud human-like scream
sounded in their ears, and the hare was seen to spring up, and stretch
her long legs in flight. At the same instant the great snowy owl was
observed wheeling above, and threatening to pounce upon the fleeing
animal!</p>

<p>The hare ran in a side direction, but it brought her as she passed
within range of the party by the sledge. The owl kept above her as
she ran. A dozen leaps was all the hare ever made. A loud crack
was heard, and she was seen to spring up and fall back upon the
snow, dead as a door-nail. Like an echo another crack followed&mdash;a
wild scream rang through the air, and the great white owl fell
fluttering to the earth. The reports were not of a rifle. They were
the louder detonations of a shot gun. All eyes were turned towards
Fran&ccedil;ois, who, like a little god, stood enveloped in a halo of blue
smoke. Fran&ccedil;ois was the hero of the hour.</p>

<p>Marengo rushed forward and seized the struggling owl, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
snapped its bill at him like a watchman's rattle. But Marengo did
not care for that; and seizing its head in his teeth, gave it a crunch
that at once put an end to its flapping.</p>

<p>Marengo was reprieved, and he seemed to know it, as he bounded
over the snow, waving his tail, and barking like a young fool.</p>

<p>They all ran up to the hare, which proved to be the &ldquo;Polar hare&rdquo;
and one of the largest of its species&mdash;not less than fifteen pounds in
weight. Its fur, soft and white like swan-down, was stained with
red blood. It was not quite dead. Its little heart yet beat faintly,
and the light of life was still shining from its beautiful honey-coloured
eyes. Both it and the owl were taken up and carried to the sledge,
which was once more attached to Marengo, as the party intended to
go forward and halt under the shelter of the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be some wood in this quarter,&rdquo; remarked Norman;
&ldquo;I never knew this sort of hare far from timber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;the Polar hare feeds upon willows, arbutus,
and the Labrador tea-plant. Some of these kinds must be near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While they were speaking, they had reached the brow of the hill,
on the opposite side from where they had ascended. On looking into
the valley below, to their great joy they beheld some clumps of
willows, and good-sized trees of poplar, birch, and spruce-pine, and
passing down the hill, the travellers soon stood in their midst. Presently
was heard the chipping sound of an axe and crash of falling
timber, and in a few moments after a column of smoke was seen
soaring up out of the valley, and curling cheerfully towards the bright
blue sky.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE JUMPING MOUSE AND THE ERMINE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">L</span>arge as the hare was, she would have made but a meal for our four
hungry voyageurs, had they eaten at will. By Lucien's advice, however,
they restrained themselves, and half of her was left for supper,
when the &ldquo;cook&rdquo; promised to make them hare-soup. The head, feet,
and other spare bits, fell to Marengo's share. The owl, whose flesh
was almost as white as its plumage, and, as Norman well knew, most
delicate eating, was reserved for to-morrow's breakfast.</p>

<p>They had pitched their tent with the intention of remaining at that
place all night, and continuing their journey next day; but, as it still
wanted several hours of sunset, and the strength of all was considerably
recruited, they resolved to hunt about the neighbourhood as
long as they had light. It was of great importance that they should
procure more game. The owl would make but a spare breakfast, and
after that where was the next meal to come from? They had had a
temporary relief, and while their strength lasted, they must use every
effort to procure a further supply. The valley in which their new
camp was placed looked well for game.</p>

<p>It was a sort of o&auml;sis in the Barren Grounds. There was a lake and
a considerable skirting of timber around it&mdash;consisting, as we have
said, of willows, poplars, spruce-pine, and dwarf birch-trees. The
Alpine arbutus, whose berries are the food of many species of animals,
also grew upon the side of the hills; and the Labrador tea-plant was
found upon the low ground around the lake. The leaves of this last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
is a favourite food of the Polar hare, and our voyageurs had no doubt
but that there were many of these animals in the neighbourhood.
Indeed, they had better evidence than conjecture, for they saw
numerous hare-tracks in the snow. There were tracks of other
animals too, for it is a well-known fact that where one kind exists, at
least two or three others will be found in the same habitat&mdash;all being
connected together by a &ldquo;chain of destruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A singular illustration of this was afforded to Lucien, who remained
at the camp while the rest went out hunting. He had gathered some
of the leaves of the Labrador tea, and was drying them over the coals,
intending to cheer his comrades with a cup of this beverage after
supper. The hare-soup was boiling, and the &ldquo;cook&rdquo; sat listening to
the cheerful sounds that issued from the pot&mdash;now and then taking
off the lid to examine its savoury contents, and give them a stir. He
would then direct his attention to the tea-leaves that were parching
in the frying-pan; and, having shifted them a little, felt himself at
liberty to look about for a minute or two.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions, while glancing up, his attention was
attracted to an object which appeared upon the snow at a short distance
from where he sat. A wreath of snow, that had formed under
the shelter of the hill, extended all around its base, presenting a steep
front in every direction. This front was only two or three feet in
height; but the top surface of the wreath was many yards wide&mdash;in
fact, it extended back until it became blended with the slope of the
hill. It was smooth and nearly level, but the hill above was steep,
and somewhat rough and rocky. The steep front of the wreath came
down within half-a-dozen paces of the fire where Lucien was seated;
and it was upon the top or scarpment of it that the object appeared
that had drawn his attention. It was a small creature, but it was in
motion, and thus had caught his eye.</p>

<p>A single glance showed him that the little animal was a mouse, but
of a somewhat singular species. It was about the size of the common
mouse, but quite different in colour. The upper half of its body was
of a light mahogany tint, while the lower half, including the legs and
feet, were of a milky whiteness. It was, in fact, the &ldquo;white-footed
mouse&rdquo; (<i>Mus leucopus</i>), one of the most beautiful of its kind.</p>

<p>Here and there above the surface of the snow protruded the tops
of arbutus-trees; and the little creature was passing from one of
these to the other, in search, no doubt, of the berries that remain upon
these trees all the winter. Sometimes it ran from point to point like
any other mouse, but now and then it would rear itself on its hind-legs,
and leap several feet at a single bound! In this it evidently
assisted itself by pressing its tail&mdash;in which it possesses muscular
power&mdash;against the snow. This peculiar mode of progression has
obtained for it the name of the &ldquo;jumping-mouse,&rdquo; and among the
Indians &ldquo;deer&rdquo;-mouse, because its leap reminds them of the bounding
spring of the deer. But there are still other species of &ldquo;jumping-mice&rdquo;
in America that possess this power to a greater degree even
than the <i>Mus leucopus</i>.</p>

<p>Lucien watched its motions without attempting to interfere with
it, until it had got nearly out of sight. He did not desire to do injury
to the little creature, nor was he curious to obtain it, as he had already
met with many specimens, and examined them to his satisfaction.
He had ceased to think of it, and would, perhaps, never have thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
of it again, but, upon turning his eyes in the opposite direction, he
observed another animal upon the snow. This creature had a far
different aspect from the mouse. Its body was nearly a foot in length,
although not much thicker than that of the other! Its legs were
short, but strong, and its forehead broad and arched convexly. It
had a tail more than half the length of the body, hairy, and tapering
like that of a cat. Its form was the well-known form of the weasel,
and it was, in fact, a species of weasel.</p>

<p>It was the celebrated <i>ermine</i>, celebrated for its soft and beautiful
fur, so long prized as an ornament for the robes of the rich. It was
white all over, with the exception of its tail; and that, for about an
inch or so at the tip, was covered with black silky hair. On some
parts of the body, too, the white was tinged with a primrose yellow;
but this tinge is not found in all animals of this species, as some individuals
are pure white. Of course it was now in its winter &ldquo;robes&rdquo;;
but in the summer it changes to a colour that does not differ much
from that of the common weasel.</p>

<p>When Lucien first saw it, it was running along the top of the
wreath, and coming from the same direction from which the mouse
had come. Now and then it paused awhile, and then ran on again.
Lucien observed that it kept its nose to the ground, and as it drew
nearer he saw that it was following on the same path which the other
had taken. To his astonishment he perceived that it was <i>trailing the
mouse</i>! Whatever the latter had doubled or made a <i>d&eacute;tour</i>, the
ermine followed the track; and where the mouse had given one of
its long leaps, there the ermine would stop, and, after beating about
until it struck the trail again, would resume its onward course at a
gallop. Its man&#339;uvres were exactly like those of a hound upon the
fresh trail of a fox!</p>

<p>Lucien now looked abroad to discover the mouse. It was still in
sight far off upon the snow, and, as Lucien could see, busily gnawing
at the arbutus, quite unconscious that its <i>greatest</i> enemy was so near.
I say greatest enemy, for the <i>Mus leucopus</i> is the <i>natural</i> prey of the
<i>Mustela erminea</i>.</p>

<p>The mouse was soon made aware of the dangerous proximity, but
not until the ermine had got within a few feet of it. When it perceived
the latter it shrunk, at first, among the leaves of the arbutus;
but seeing there would be no protection there&mdash;as the other was still
springing forward to seize it&mdash;it leaped up, and endeavoured to escape
by flight. Its flight appeared to be in alternate jumps and
runs, but the chase was not a long one. The ermine was as active as
a cat, and, after a few skips, its claws were struck into the mouse.
There was a short, slender squeak, and then a &ldquo;crunch,&rdquo; like the
cracking of a hazel-nut. This last sound was produced by the teeth
of the ermine breaking through the skull of its victim.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE ARCTIC FOX AND WHITE WOLF.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">L</span>ucien turned round to get hold of his rifle, intending to punish the
ermine, although the little creature, in doing what it did, had only
obeyed a law of nature. But the boy had also another design in
killing it: he wished to compare it with some ermines he had seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
while travelling upon Lake Winnipeg, which, as he thought, were
much larger&mdash;one that he had caught having measured more than a
foot in length, without including the tail. He wished, also, to make
some comparison between it and the common weasel; for in its
<i>winter dress</i>, in the snowy regions, the latter very much resembles
the ermine; and, indeed, the trappers make no distinction between
them.</p>

<p>With these ideas Lucien had grasped his gun, and was raising
himself to creep a little nearer, when his eye was arrested by the
motions of another creature coming along the top of the wreath.
This last was a snow-white animal, with long, shaggy fur, sharp-pointed
snout, erect ears, and bushy tail. Its aspect was fox-like, and
its movements and attitudes had all that semblance of cunning and
caution so characteristic of these animals. Well might it, for it <i>was</i>
a fox&mdash;the beautiful white fox of the Arctic regions.</p>

<p>It is commonly supposed that there are but two or three kinds of
foxes in America; and that these are only varieties of the European
species.</p>

<p>This is an erroneous idea, as there are nearly a dozen varieties
existing in North America, although they may be referred to a less
number of species. There is the Arctic fox, which is confined to the
cold Northern regions, and which in winter is white.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;sooty-fox&rdquo; is a variety of the &ldquo;Arctic,&rdquo; distinguished from it
only by its colour, which is of a uniform blackish brown.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;American fox&rdquo; or, as it is commonly called, the &ldquo;red fox,&rdquo; has
been long supposed to be the same as the European red fox. This is
erroneous. They differ in many points; and, what is somewhat
curious, these points of difference are similar to those that exist
between the European and American wolves, as already given.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;cross fox&rdquo; is supposed by the Indians and some naturalists
to be only a variety of the last. It derives its name from its having
two dark stripes crossing each other upon the shoulders. Its fur
from this circumstance, and perhaps because the animal is scarce, is
more prized than that of the red variety. When a single skin of the
latter is worth only fifteen shillings, one of the cross fox will bring as
much as five guineas.</p>

<p>Another variety of the red fox, and a much more rare one, is the
&ldquo;black,&rdquo; or &ldquo;silver&rdquo; fox. The skins of these command six times the
price of any other furs found in America, with the exception of the
sea-otter. The animal itself is so rare that only a few fall into the
hands of the Hudson's Bay Company in a season; and Mr. Nicholay,
the celebrated London furrier, asserts that a single skin will fetch
from ten to forty guineas, according to quality. A remarkable cloak,
or pelisse, belonging to the Emperor of Russia, and made out of the
skins of silver-foxes, was exhibited in the Great London Exposition
of 1851. It was made entirely from the neck-part of the skins&mdash;the
only part of the silver-fox which is pure black. This cloak was
valued at 3400<i>l</i>.; though Mr. Nicholay considers this an exaggerated
estimate, and states its true value to be not over 1000<i>l.</i> George the
Fourth had a lining of black fox-skins worth 1000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The &ldquo;grey fox&rdquo; is a more southern species than any already described.
Its proper home is the temperate zone covered by the United
States; although it extends its range into the southern parts of
Canada. In the United States it is the most common kind, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
in that district there is also a &ldquo;red fox,&rdquo; different from the <i>Vulpus
fulvus</i> already noticed; and which, no doubt, is the red fox of Europe,
introduced by the early colonists of America.</p>

<p>Still another species, the smallest and perhaps the most interesting
of any, is the &ldquo;kit fox.&rdquo; This little creature is an inhabitant of the
prairies, where it makes its burrows far from any wood. It is extremely
shy, and the swiftest animal in the prairie country&mdash;outrunning
even the antelope!</p>

<p>When Lucien saw the fox he thought no more of the ermine, but
drew back and crouched down, in hopes he might get a shot at the
larger animal. He knew well that the flesh of the Arctic fox is highly
esteemed as food, particularly by persons situated as he and his companions
were, and he hoped to be able to add it to their larder.</p>

<p>When first seen it was coming towards him, though not in a direct
line. It was engaged in hunting, and, with its nose to the snow, was
running in zig-zag lines, &ldquo;quartering&rdquo; the ground like a pointer dog.
Presently it struck the trail of the ermine, and with a yelp of satisfaction
followed it. This of course brought it close past where Lucien
was; but, notwithstanding his eagerness to fire, it moved so rapidly
along the trail that he was unable to take sight upon it. It did not
halt for a moment; and, as Lucien's gun was a rifle, he knew that a
flying shot would be an uncertain one. In the belief, therefore, that
the fox would stop soon&mdash;at all events when it came up with the
ermine&mdash;he restrained himself from firing, and waited.</p>

<p>It ran on, still keeping the track of the ermine. The latter, hitherto
busy with his own prey, did not see the fox until it was itself seen,
when, dropping the half-eaten mouse, it reared up on its hind-quarters
like a squirrel or a monkey, at the same time spitting as spitefully as
any other weasel could have done. In a moment, however, it changed
its tactics&mdash;for the open jaws of the fox were within a few paces of
it&mdash;and after making a short quick run along the surface, it threw up
its hind-quarters, and plunged head-foremost into the snow! The
fox sprang forward, and flinging his brush high in the air, shot after
like an arrow!</p>

<p>Both had now disappeared from Lucien's sight. For a moment the
surface of the snow was disturbed above the spot where they had gone
down, but the next moment all was still, and no evidence existed that
a living creature had been there, except the tracks, and the break the
two creatures had made in going down. Lucien ran forward until he
was within a few yards of the place, and stood watching the hole,
with his rifle ready&mdash;thinking that the fox, at least, would soon come
up again.</p>

<p>He had waited for nearly five minutes, looking steadily at this point,
when his eye was attracted by a movement under the snow, at a considerable
distance, quite fifty paces, from where he stood. The frozen
crust was seen to upheave: and, the next moment, the head of the
fox, and afterwards his whole body, appeared above the surface.
Lucien saw that the ermine lay transversely between his jaws, and
was quite dead! He was about to fire, but the fox, suddenly perceiving
him, shot off like an arrow, carrying his prey along with him.</p>

<p>He was soon out of reach, and Lucien, seeing that he had lost his
chance, was about to return to the fire, when, all at once, the fox was
observed to stop, turn suddenly in his tracks, and run off in a new
direction! Lucien looked beyond to ascertain the cause of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
strange man&#339;uvre. That was soon ascertained. Coming down from
among the rocks was a large animal&mdash;five times the fox's size&mdash;but in
other respects not unlike him. It was also of a snow-white colour,
with long hair, bushy tail, and short erect ears, but its aspect was not
to be mistaken. It was the great <i>white wolf</i>.</p>

<p>When Lucien first saw this new-comer, the latter had just espied
the fox, and was about stretching out into a gallop towards him.
The fox, <i>watching backwards</i> as he ran, had not seen the wolf, until
the latter was within a few springs of him; and now when he had
turned, and both were in full chase, there was not over twenty yards
between them. The direction in which they ran would bring them
near to Lucien; and so they came, and passed him&mdash;neither of them
seeming to heed his presence. They had not got many yards farther,
before Lucien perceived that the wolf was fast closing on the fox,
and would soon capture him. Believing he would then stop, so as to
offer him a fairer chance for a shot, Lucien followed. The wolf,
however, had noticed him coming after, and although the next
moment he closed his great jaws upon the fox, he did not pause for
a single instant, but, lifting the latter clear up from the ground, ran
on without the slightest apparent diminution of speed!</p>

<p>Reynard was seen to struggle and kick, while he squeaked like a
shot puppy; but his cries each moment grew feebler, and his
struggles soon came to an end. The wolf held him transversely in
his jaws&mdash;just as he himself but the moment before had carried the
ermine.</p>

<p>Lucien saw there was no use in following them, as the wolf ran on
with his prey. With some disappointment, therefore, he was about
to return to the fire, where, to add to his mortification, he knew he
would find his tea-leaves parched to a cinder. He lingered a moment,
however, with his eyes still fixed upon the departing wolf that was
just about to disappear over the crest of a ridge. The fox was still
in his jaws, but no longer struggling. Reynard looked limber and
dead, as his legs swung loosely on both sides of the wolf's head
Lucien at that moment saw the latter suddenly stop in his career,
and then drop down upon the surface of the snow as if dead! He
fell with his victim in his jaws, and lay half doubled up, and quite still.</p>

<p>This strange action would have been a difficult thing for Lucien to
explain, but, almost at the same instant in which he observed it, a
puff of blue smoke shot up over the ridge, and quickly following was
heard the sharp crack of a rifle. Then a head with its cap of raccoon
skin appeared above the snow, and Lucien, recognising the face of
Basil, ran forward to meet him.</p>

<p>Both soon stood over the body of the dead wolf, wondering at what
they saw; but Basil, far more than Lucien&mdash;for the latter already
knew the circumstances of that strange scene of death. First there
was the great gaunt body of the wolf stretched along the snow, and
quite dead. Cross-ways in his mouth was the fox, just as he had
been carried off; and across the jaws of the latter, lay the long
worm-like body of the ermine, still retaining between its teeth the
half-devoured remains of the white-footed mouse! A very chain of
destroyers! These creatures died as they had lived, preying one
upon the other! Of all four the little mouse alone was an innocent
victim. The other three, though morally guilty by the laws of man,
yet were only acting in obedience to the laws of Nature and necessity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>Man himself obeys a similar law, as Basil had just shown. Philosophize
as we will, we cannot comprehend why it is so&mdash;why Nature
requires the sacrifice of one of her creatures for the sustenance of
another. But although we cannot understand the cause, we must
not condemn the fact as it exists; nor must we suppose, as some do,
that the destruction of God's creatures for our necessities constitutes
a crime. They who think so, and who, in consistency with their
doctrines, confine themselves to what they term &ldquo;vegetable&rdquo; food,
are at best but shallow reasoners. They have not studied Nature
very closely, else would they know that every time they pluck up a
parsnip, or draw their blade across the leaf of a lettuce, they cause
pain and death!</p>

<p>How much pain we cannot tell; but that the plant feels, as well as
the animal, we can clearly <i>prove</i>. Probably it feels less, and it may
be each kind of plant differs from others in the amount, according to
its higher or lower organism. Probably its amount of pleasure&mdash;its
capability of enjoyment&mdash;is in a direct proportion to the pain which
it endures; and it is highly probable that this double line of ratios
runs in an ascending scale throughout the vegetable kingdom, gradually
joining on to what is more strictly termed the &ldquo;animal.&rdquo; But
these mysteries of life, my young friend, will be interesting studies
for you when your mind becomes matured.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be your fortune to unravel some of them, for the
benefit of your fellow-men. I feel satisfied that you will not only be
a student of Nature, but one of her great teachers; you will far surpass
the author of this little book in your knowledge of Nature's
laws; but it will always be a happiness to him to reflect, that, when
far advanced upon the highway of science, you will look back to him
as one you had passed upon the road, and who <i>pointed you to the
path</i>.</p>

<p>Though Basil had shot the wolf, it was plain that it was not the
first nor yet the second time he had discharged his rifle since leaving
the camp. From his game-bag protruded the curving claws and
wing-tips of a great bird. In one hand he carried a white hare&mdash;not
the Polar hare&mdash;but a much smaller kind, also an inhabitant of these
snowy regions; and over his shoulders was slung a fierce-looking
creature, the great wild-cat or lynx of America. The bird in his bag
was the golden eagle, one of the few feathered creatures that brave
the fierce winter of a northern climate, and does not migrate, like its
congeners, the &ldquo;white-head&rdquo; and the osprey, to more southern
regions.</p>

<p>Basil had returned alone&mdash;for the three, Basil, Norman, and Fran&ccedil;ois,
had taken different directions at setting out. This they had
done, in order to have as great a number of chances as possible of
finding the game. Norman came in a few minutes after, bearing a
whole deer upon his shoulders&mdash;a glad sight that was&mdash;and, a short
interval having passed, Fran&ccedil;ois's &ldquo;hurrah&rdquo; sounded upon their ears,
and Fran&ccedil;ois himself was seen coming up the valley loaded like a
little donkey with two bunches of large snow-white birds.</p>

<p>The camp now exhibited a cheering sight. Such a variety was
never seen even in the larder of a palace kitchen. The ground was
strewed with animals like a dead menagerie. There were no less
than a dozen kinds upon it!</p>

<p>The hare-soup was now quite ready, and was accordingly served<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
up by Lucien in the best style. Lucien had dried a fresh &ldquo;grist&rdquo; of
the tea leaves, and a cheering cup followed; and then the party all
sat around their log-fire, while each of them detailed the history of
his experience since parting with the others.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois was the first to relate what had befallen him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE JERFALCON AND THE WHITE GROUSE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">&ldquo;M</span>ine,&rdquo; began Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;was a bird adventure, as you all see&mdash;though
what kind of birds I've shot, <i>I</i> can't tell. One of them's a
hawk, I'm sure; but it's a <i>white</i> hawk, and that I never saw before.
The rest, I suppose, are <i>white</i> partridges. Everything appears to be
white here. What are they, Luce?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right about this first,&rdquo; answered Lucien, taking up one of
the birds which Fran&ccedil;ois had brought back with him, and which was
white all but a few spots of clove-brown upon its back. &ldquo;This is a
hawk, as you may tell, by its appearance, or rather I should say a
'falcon,' for you must know there is a difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What difference?&rdquo; demanded Fran&ccedil;ois, with some eagerness of
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the principal difference is the formation of their beaks or
bills. The bills of the true falcons are stronger, and have a notch in
the lower mandible answering to a tooth in the upper one. Their
nostrils, too, are differently formed. But another point of distinction
is found in their habits. Both feed on warm-blooded animals, and
neither will eat carrion. In this respect the hawks and falcons are
alike. Both take their prey upon the wing; but herein lies the
difference. The hawks capture it by skimming along horizontally or
obliquely, and picking it up as they pass; whereas the true falcons
'pounce' down upon it from above, and in a line nearly vertical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then this must be a true falcon,&rdquo; interrupted Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;for I
saw the gentleman do that very thing; and beautifully he did it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a falcon,&rdquo; continued Lucien; &ldquo;and of the many species of
hawks which inhabit North America&mdash;over twenty in all&mdash;it is one
of the boldest and handsomest. I don't wonder you never saw it
before; for it is truly a bird of the Northern regions, and does not
come so far south as the territory of the United States, much less
into Louisiana. It is found in North Europe, Greenland, and Iceland,
and has been seen as far north on both continents as human beings
have travelled. It is known by the name of 'jerfalcon,' or 'gyrfalcon,'
but its zoological name is <i>Falco Islandicus</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Indians here,&rdquo; interposed Norman, &ldquo;call it by a name that
means 'winter bird,' or 'winterer'&mdash;I suppose, because it is one of the
few that stay in these parts all the year round, and is therefore often
noticed by them in winter time. The traders sometimes call it the
'speckled partridge-hawk,' for there are some of them more spotted
than this one is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Lucien; &ldquo;the young ones are nearly of a brown colour,
and they first become spotted or mottled after a year or two. They
are several years old before they get the white plumage, and very few
individuals are seen of a pure white all over, though there are some
without a spot.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the naturalist, &ldquo;it is the jerfalcon; and those
other birds which you call 'white partridges,' are the very creatures
upon which it preys. So you have killed both the tyrant and his
victims. They are not partridges though, but grouse&mdash;that species
known as 'willow grouse.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as Lucien said this, he began to handle the birds, which were
of a beautiful white all over, with the exception of the tail feathers.
These last were pitch-black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien, in some surprise, &ldquo;you have two kinds
here! Were they all together when you shot them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Fran&ccedil;ois; &ldquo;one I shot along with the hawk out
in the open ground. All the others I killed upon a tree in a piece of
woods that I fell in with. There's no difference between them that I
can see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;although I acknowledge they all look
very much alike. Both are feathered to the toes&mdash;both have the
black feathers in the tail&mdash;and the bills of both are black; but if you
observe closely, this kind&mdash;the willow-grouse&mdash;has the bill much
stronger and less flattened. Besides, it is a larger bird than the
other, which is 'the rock-grouse.' Both are sometimes, though
erroneously, called 'ptarmigan;' but they are not the true ptarmigan&mdash;such
as exist in North Europe&mdash;though these last are also to be met
with in the Northern parts of America. The ptarmigan are somewhat
larger than either of these kinds, but in other respects differ
but little from them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The habits of the 'rock' and 'willow' grouse are very similar.
They are both birds of the snowy region, and are found as far north
as has been explored. The willow-grouse in winter keep more among
the trees, and are oftener met with in wooded countries; whereas the
others like best to live in the open ground, and, from your statement,
it appears you found each kind in its favourite haunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois. &ldquo;After leaving here, I kept down the
valley, and was just crossing an open piece of high ground, when I
espied the white hawk, or falcon as you call it, hovering in the air as
I'd often seen hawks do. Well, I stopped and hid behind a rock,
thinking I might have a chance to put a few drops into him. All at
once he appeared to stand still in the air, and, then closing his wings,
shot down like an arrow. Just then I heard a loud '<i>whur-r-r</i>,' and
up started a whole covey of white partridges&mdash;grouse, I should say&mdash;the
same as this you call the 'rock-grouse.' I saw that the hawk had
missed the whole of them, and I marked them as they flew off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They pitched about a hundred yards or so, and then went plunge
under the snow&mdash;every one of them making a hole for itself just like
where one had poked their foot in! I guess, boys, this looked funny
enough. I thought I would be sure to get a shot at some of these
grouse as they came out again; so I walked straight up to the holes
they had made, and stood waiting. I still saw the hawk hovering in
the air, about an hundred yards ahead of me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was considering whether I ought to go farther on, and tramp the
birds out of the snow; for I believed, of course, they were still under
the place where the holes were. All at once I noticed a movement on
the crust of the snow right under where the hawk was flying, and
then that individual shot down to the spot, and disappeared under
the snow! At the same instant, the crust broke in several places, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
up came the grouse one after another, and whirred off out of sight,
without giving me any sort of a chance. The hawk, however, had
not come up yet; and I ran forward, determined to take him as soon
as he should make his appearance. When I had got within shooting
distance, up he fluttered to the surface, and&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;he
had one of the grouse struggling in his claws! I let him have the
right barrel, and both he and grousy were knocked dead as a couple
of door-nails!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I might fall in with the others again; and kept on in the
direction they had taken, which brought me at last to a piece of woodland
consisting of birches and willow-trees. As I was walking along
the edge of this, I noticed one of the willows, at some distance off,
covered with great white things, that at first I took for flakes of snow;
but then I thought it curious that none of the other trees had the
same upon them. As I came a little nearer, I noticed one of the
things moving, and then I saw they were birds, and very like the
same I had just seen, and was then in search of. So I crept in among
the trees; and, after some dodging, got within beautiful shooting
distance, and gave them both barrels. There, you see the result!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Fran&ccedil;ois triumphantly pointed to the pile of birds, which in
all, with the jerfalcon, counted four brace and a half.</p>

<p>One was the rock-grouse, which the falcon had itself killed, and the
others were willow-grouse, as Lucien had stated. Fran&ccedil;ois now remained
silent, while Basil related his day's adventure.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE HARE, THE LYNX, AND THE GOLDEN EAGLE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">&ldquo;F</span>rank,&rdquo; began he, &ldquo;has called his 'a bird adventure.' I might
give mine somewhat of the same title, for there was a bird mixed up
with it&mdash;the noblest of all birds&mdash;the eagle. But you shall hear it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On leaving the camp, I went, as you all know, up the valley.
After travelling for a quarter of a mile or so, I came upon a wide
open bottom, where there were some scattered willows and clumps of
dwarf birch-trees. As Luce had told me that such are the favourite
food of the American hare, or, as we call it in Louisiana, 'rabbit,'
I looked out for the sign of one, and, sure enough, I soon came upon
a track, which I knew to be that of 'puss.' It was fresh enough, and
I followed it. It kept me meandering about for a long while, till
at last I saw that it took a straight course for some thick brushwood,
with two or three low birches growing out of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I made sure of finding the game there, I crept forward very
quietly, holding Marengo in the leash. But the hare was not in the
brush; and, after tramping all through it, I again noticed the
track where she had gone out on the opposite side. I was about
starting forth to follow it, when all at once an odd-looking creature
made its appearance right before me. It was that fellow there!&rdquo;
And Basil pointed to the lynx. &ldquo;I thought at first sight,&rdquo; continued
he, &ldquo;it was our Louisiana wild cat or bay lynx, as Luce calls it, for
it is very like our cat; but I saw it was nearly twice as big, and
more greyish in the fur. Well, when I first sighted the creature,
it was about an hundred yards off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hadn't seen me, though, for it was not running away, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
skulking along slowly&mdash;nearly crosswise to the course of the hare's
track&mdash;and looking in a different direction to that in which I was.
I was well screened behind the bushes, and that, no doubt, prevented
it from noticing me. At first I thought of running forward, and
setting Marengo after it. Then I determined on staying where
I was, and watching it a while. Perhaps it may come to a stop,
reflected I, and let me creep within shot. I remained, therefore,
crouching among the bushes, and kept the dog at my feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I continued to watch the cat, I saw that, instead of following
a straight line, it was moving in a circle!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The diameter of this circle was not over an hundred yards; and in
a very short while the animal had got once round the circumference,
and came back to where I had first seen it. It did not stop there,
but continued on, though not in its old tracks. It still walked in
a circle, but a much smaller one than before. Both, however, had
a common centre; and, as I noticed that the animal kept its eyes
constantly turned towards the centre, I felt satisfied that in that
place would be found the cause of its strange man&#339;uvring. I looked
to the centre. At first I could see nothing&mdash;at least nothing that
might be supposed to attract the cat. There was a very small bush
of willows, but they were thin. I could see distinctly through them,
and there was no creature there, either in the bush or around it.
The snow lay white up to the roots of the willows, and I thought
that a mouse could hardly have found shelter among them, without
my seeing it from where I stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still I could not explain the odd actions of the lynx, upon any
other principle than that it was in the pursuit of game; and I looked
again, and carefully examined every inch of the ground as my eyes
passed over it. This time I discovered what the animal was after.
Close into the willows appeared two little parallel streaks of a dark
colour, just rising above the surface of the snow. I should not have
noticed them had there not been two of them, and these slanting in
the same direction. They had caught my eyes before, but I had
taken them for the points of broken willows. I now saw that they
were the ears of some animal, and I thought that once or twice they
moved slightly while I was regarding them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After looking at them steadily for a time, I made out the shape of
a little head underneath. It was white, but there was a round dark
spot in the middle, which I knew to be an eye. There was no body
to be seen. That was under the snow, but it was plain enough that
what I saw was the head of a hare. At first I supposed it to be
a Polar hare&mdash;such as we had just killed&mdash;but the tracks I had
followed were not those of the Polar hare. Then I remembered that
the 'rabbit' of the United States also turns white in the winter of
the Northern regions. This, then, must be the American rabbit,
thought I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course my reflections did not occupy all the time I have taken
in describing them. Only a moment or so. All the while the lynx
was moving round and round the circle, but still getting nearer to
the hare that appeared eagerly to watch it. I remembered how
Norman had man&#339;uvred to get within shot of the Polar hare;
and I now saw the very same <i>ruse</i> being practised by a dumb
creature, that is supposed to have no other guide than instinct. But
I had seen the 'bay lynx' of Louisiana do some 'dodges' as cunning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
as that,&mdash;such as claying his feet to make the hounds lose the scent,
and, after running backwards and forwards upon a fallen log, leap
into the tops of trees, and get off in that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believing that his Northern cousin was just as artful as himself&rdquo;
(here Basil looked significantly at the &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo;) &ldquo;I did not so
much wonder at the performance I now witnessed. Nevertheless,
I felt a great curiosity to see it out. But for this curiosity I could
have shot the lynx every time he passed me on the nearer edge of
the circle. Round and round he went, then, until he was not twenty
feet from the hare, that, strange to say, seemed to regard this the
worst of her enemies more with wonder than fear. The lynx at
length stopped suddenly, brought his four feet close together, arched
his back like an angry cat, and then with one immense bound,
sprang forward upon his victim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hare had only time to leap out of her form, and the second
spring of the lynx brought him right upon the top of her. I could
hear the child-like scream which the American rabbit always utters
when thus seized; but the cloud of snow-spray raised above the
spot prevented me for a while from seeing either lynx or hare. The
scream was stifled in a moment, and when the snow-spray cleared
off, I saw that the lynx held the hare under his paws, and that
'puss' was quite dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was considering how I might best steal up within shooting
distance, when, all at once, I heard another scream of a very different
sort. At the same time a dark shadow passed over the snow. I
looked up, and there, within fifty yards of the ground, a great big
bird was wheeling about. I knew it to be an eagle from its shape;
and at first I fancied it was a young one of the white-headed kind&mdash;for,
as you are aware, these do not have either the white head or
tail until they are several years old. Its immense size, however,
showed that it could not be one of these. It must be the great
<i>'golden' eagle</i> of the Rocky Mountains, thought I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I first noticed it, I fancied that it had been after the rabbit;
and, seeing the latter pounced upon by another preying creature,
had uttered its scream at being thus disappointed of its prey. I
expected, therefore, to see it fly off. To my astonishment it broke
suddenly out of the circles in which it had been so gracefully wheeling,
and, with another scream wilder than before, darted down
towards the lynx!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The latter, on hearing the first cry of the eagle, had started, dropped
his prey, and looked up. In the eagle he evidently recognised an
antagonist, for his back suddenly became arched, his fur bristled up,
his short tail moved quickly from side to side, and he stood with
glaring eyes, and claws ready to receive the attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the eagle came down, its legs and claws were thrown forward,
and I could then tell it was not a bald eagle, nor the great &ldquo;Washington
eagle,&rdquo; nor yet a fishing eagle of any sort, which both of these are.
The fishing eagles, as Lucien had told me, <i>have always naked legs</i>,
while those of the true eagles are more feathered. So were his, but
beyond the feathers I could see his great curved talons, as he struck
forward at the lynx. He evidently touched and wounded the animal,
but the wound only served to make it more angry: and I could hear
it purring and spitting like a tom-cat, only far louder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The eagle again mounted back into the air, but soon wheeled round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
and shot down a second time. This time the lynx sprang forward to
meet it, and I could hear the concussion of their bodies as they came
together. I think the eagle must have been crippled, so that it could
not fly up again, for the fight from that time was carried on upon the
ground. The lynx seemed anxious to grasp some part of his antagonist's
body&mdash;and at times I thought he had succeeded&mdash;but then
he was beaten off again by the bird, that fought furiously with wings,
beak, and talons.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/illus-150.jpg" width="348" height="500" alt="THE LYNX AND THE GOLDEN EAGLE." title="THE LYNX AND THE GOLDEN EAGLE" />
<span class="caption">THE LYNX AND THE GOLDEN EAGLE.</span></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>&ldquo;The lynx now appeared to be the attacking party, as I saw him repeatedly
spring forward at the eagle, while the latter always received
him upon its claws, lying with its back upon the snow. Both fur and
feathers flew in every direction, and sometimes the combatants were
so covered with the snow-spray that I could see neither of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I watched the conflict for several minutes, until it occurred to me,
that my best time to get near enough for a shot was just while they
were in the thick of it, and not likely to heed me. I therefore moved
silently out of the bushes; and, keeping Marengo in the string, crept
forward. I had but the one bullet to give them, and with that I could
not shoot both; but I knew that the quadruped was eatable, and, as
I was not sure about the bird, I very easily made choice, and shot the
lynx. To my surprise the eagle did not fly off, and I now saw that
one of its wings was disabled! He was still strong enough, however,
to scratch Marengo severely before the latter could master him. As
to the lynx, he had been roughly handled. His skin was torn in
several places, and one of his eyes, as you see, regularly 'gouged out.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Basil ended his narration; and after an interval, during which
some fresh wood was chopped and thrown upon the fire, Norman, in
turn, commenced relating what had befallen him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE &ldquo;ALARM BIRD&rdquo; AND THE CARIBOU.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">&ldquo;T</span>here wasn't much 'adventure' in my day's sport,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though
I might call it a 'bird-adventure' too, for if it hadn't been for a bird
I shouldn't have had it. I shot a deer&mdash;that's all. But maybe it
would be curious for you to know how I came to find the animal, so
I'll tell you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first thing I did after leaving here was to climb the hill
yonder&rdquo;&mdash;here Norman pointed to a long hill that sloped up from
the opposite shore of the lake, and which was the direction he had
taken, as Basil and Fran&ccedil;ois had gone right and left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw neither bird, beast, nor track, until I had reached the top of
the hill. There I got a good view of the country ahead. I saw it
was very rocky, without a stick of timber, and did not look very
promising for game. 'It's no use going that way,' I says to myself;
&ldquo;I'll keep along the ridge, above where Frank's gone. He may drive
some varmint out of the hollow, and I'll get a crack at it, as it comes
over the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about to turn to the left when I heard the skreek of a bird
away ahead of me. I looked in that direction; and, sure enough,
saw one wheeling about in the air, right above the rocky jumble with
which the country was covered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it's a mighty curious bird that I saw. It's a sort of an owl,
but, I should say myself, there's a sprinkling of the hawk in it&mdash;for
it's as much like the one as the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; interrupted Lucien, &ldquo;it was one of the day owls of
these Northern regions, some of which approach very near to the
hawks, both in shape and habits. This peculiarity arises from the
fact of the long summer day&mdash;of weeks in duration&mdash;within the Arctic
circle, requiring them to hunt for their prey, just as hawks do; and
therefore Nature has gifted them with certain peculiarities that make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
them resemble these birds. They want the very broad faces and large
tufted heads of the true owls; besides the ears, which in the latter
are remarkable for their size, and also for being operculated, or with
lids, in the former are not much larger than in other birds of prey.
The small hawk-owl which is altogether a Northern bird, is one of
this kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; continued Norman, &ldquo;what you say may be very true,
cousin Luce; I only know that the bird I am speaking about is a
mighty curious little creature. It ain't bigger than a pigeon, and is
of a mottled brown colour; but what I call it curious for is this:&mdash;Whenever
it sees any creature passing from place to place, it mounts
up into the air, and hovers above them, keeping up a constant
screeching, like the squalling of a child&mdash;and that's anything but
agreeable. It does so, not only in the neighbourhood of its nest&mdash;like
the plover and some other birds&mdash;but it will sometimes follow a
travelling party for hours together, and for miles across the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this circumstance the Indians of these parts call it the &ldquo;alarm
bird,&rdquo; or &ldquo;bird of warning,&rdquo; because it often makes them aware of
the approach either of their enemies or of strangers. Sometimes it
alarms and startles the game, while the hunter is crawling up to it;
and I have known it to bother myself for a while of a day, when I
was after grouse. It's a great favourite with the Indians though&mdash;as
it often guides them to deer, or musk-oxen, by its flying and screaming
above where these animals are feeding.</p>

<p>Just in the same way it guided me. I knew, from the movements
of the bird, that there must be something among the rocks. I
couldn't tell what, but I hoped it would turn out to be some creature
that was eatable; so I changed my intention, and struck out for the
place where it was.</p>

<p>It was a good half mile from the hill, and it cost me considerable
clambering over the rocks, before I reached the ground. I thought
to get near enough to see what it was, without drawing the bird upon
myself, and I crouched from hummock to hummock; but the sharp-eyed
creature caught sight of me, and came screeching over my head.
I kept on without noticing it; but as I was obliged to go round some
large rocks, I lost the direction, and soon found myself wandering
back into my own trail.</p>

<p>I could do nothing, therefore, until the bird should leave me, and
fly back to whatever had first set it a-going. In order that it might
do so, I crept in under a big stone that jutted out, and lay quiet a
bit, watching it. It soon flew off, and commenced wheeling about in
the air, not more than three hundred yards from where I lay. This
time I took good bearings, and then went on. I did not care for the
bird to guide me any longer, for I observed there was an open spot
ahead, and I was sure that there I could see something. And sure
enough I did. On peeping round the end of a rock, I spied a herd of
about fifty deer.</p>

<p>They were reindeer, of course, as there are no others upon the
'Barren Grounds,' and I saw they were all does&mdash;for at this season
the bucks keep altogether in the woods. Some of them were pawing
the snow to get at the moss, while others were standing by the rocks,
and tearing off the lichens with their teeth. It so happened that I
had the wind of them, else they would have scented me and made off,
for I was within a hundred yards of the nearest. I was not afraid of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
their taking fright, so long as they could only see part of my body&mdash;for
these deer are so stupid, or rather so curious, that almost anything
will draw them within shot.</p>

<p>Knowing this, I practised a trick that had often helped me before;
and that was to move the barrel of my gun, up and down, with the
same sort of motion as the deer make with their horns, when rubbing
their necks against a rock or tree. If I'd had a set of antlers, it
would have been all the better; but the other answered well enough.
It happened the animals were not very wild, as, likely, they hadn't
been hunted for a good while. I bellowed at the same time,&mdash;for I
know how to imitate their call&mdash;and, in less than a minute's time, I
got several of them within range. Then I took aim, and knocked one
over, and the rest ran off. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Norman, &ldquo;ended <i>my</i> adventure&mdash;unless
you call the carrying a good hundred pounds weight of
deer-meat all the way back to camp part of it. If so, I can assure
you that it was by far the most unpleasant part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Norman finished his narration, and a conversation was carried
on upon the subject of reindeer, or, as these animals are termed, in
America, &ldquo;caribou.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucien said that the reindeer is found in the Northern regions of
Europe and Asia as well as in America, but that there were several
varieties of them, and perhaps there were different species. Those
of Lapland are most celebrated, because they not only draw sledges,
but also furnish food, clothing, and many other commodities for their
owners. In the north of Asia, the Tungusians have a much larger
sort, which they ride upon; and the Koreki, who dwell upon the
borders of Kamschatka, possess vast herds of reindeer&mdash;some rich
individuals owing as many as ten or twenty thousand!</p>

<p>It is not certain that the reindeer of America is exactly the same
as either of the kinds mentioned; and indeed in America itself there
are two very distinct kinds&mdash;perhaps a third. Two kinds are well
known, that differ from each other in size, and also in habits. One
is the &ldquo;Barren Ground caribou,&rdquo; and the other, the &ldquo;Woodland
caribou.&rdquo; The former is one of the smallest of the deer kind&mdash;the
bucks weighing little over one hundred pounds. As its name implies,
it frequents the Barren Grounds, although in winter it also seeks the
shelter of wooded tracts. Upon the Barren Grounds, and the desolate
shores and islands of the Arctic Sea, it is the only kind of deer found,
except at one or two points, as the mouth of the Mackenzie River&mdash;which
happens to be a wooded country, and there the moose also is
met with.</p>

<p>Nature seems to have gifted the Barren Ground caribou with such
tastes and habits, that a fertile country and a genial clime would not
be a pleasant home for it. It seems adapted to the bleak, sterile
countries in which it dwells, and where its favourite food&mdash;the
mosses and lichens&mdash;is found. In the short summer of the Arctic
regions, it ranges still farther north; and its traces have been found
wherever the Northern navigators have gone. It must remain among
the icy islands of the Arctic Sea until winter be considerably advanced,
or until the sea is so frozen as to allow it to get back to the shores of
the continent.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Woodland caribou&rdquo; is a larger variety&mdash;a Woodland doe
being about as big as a Barren Ground buck&mdash;although the horns of
the latter species are larger and more branching than those of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
former. The Woodland kind are found around the shores of Hudson's
Bay, and in other wooded tracts that lie in the southern parts of the
fur countries&mdash;into which the Barren Ground caribou never penetrates.
They also migrate annually, but, strange to say, their spring migrations
are southward, while, at the same season, their cousins of the
Barren Grounds are making their way northward to the shores of the
Arctic Sea. This is a very singular difference in their habits, and
along with their difference in bulk, form, &amp;c., entitles them to be
ranked as separate species of deer.</p>

<p>The flesh of the Woodland caribou is not esteemed so good an
article of food as that of the other; and, as it inhabits a district
where many large animals are found, it is not considered of so much
importance in the economy of human life. The &ldquo;Barren Ground
caribou,&rdquo; on the other hand, is an indispensable animal to various
tribes of Indians, as well as to the Esquimaux. Without it, these
people would be unable to dwell where they do; and although they
have not domesticated it, and trained it to draught, like the Laplanders,
it forms their main source of subsistence, and there is no part
of its body which they do not turn to some useful purpose.</p>

<p>Of its horns they form their fish-spears and hooks, and, previous to
the introduction of iron by the Europeans, their ice-chisels and various
other utensils. Their scraping or currying knives are made from the
split shin-bones. The skins make their clothing, tent-covers, beds,
and blankets. The raw hide, cleared of the hair and cut into thongs,
serves for snares, bow-strings, net-lines, and every other sort of ropes.
The finer thongs make netting for snow-shoes&mdash;an indispensable
article to these people&mdash;and of these thongs fish-nets are also woven;
while the tendons of the muscles, when split, serve for fine sewing-thread.
Besides these uses, the flesh of the caribou is the food of
many tribes, Indians and Esquimaux, for most of the year; and,
indeed, it may be looked upon as their staple article of subsistence.</p>

<p>There is hardly any part of it (even the horns, when soft) that is
not eaten and relished by them. Were it not for the immense herds
of these creatures that roam over the country, they would soon be
exterminated&mdash;for they are easily approached, and the Indians have
very little difficulty, during the summer season, in killing as many as
they please.</p>

<p>Norman next gave a description of the various modes of hunting
the caribou practised by the Indians and Esquimaux; such as driving
them into a pound, snaring them, decoying and shooting them with
arrows, and also a singular way which the Esquimaux have of taking
them in a pit-trap built in the snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sides of the trap,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are built of slabs of snow, cut as
if to make a snow-house. An inclined plane of snow leads to the
entrance of the pit, which is about five feet deep, and large enough
within to hold several deer. The exterior of the trap is banked up
on all sides with snow; but so steep are these sides left, that the deer
can only get up by the inclined plane which leads to the entrance.
A great slab of snow is then placed over the mouth of the pit, and
revolves on two axles of wood. This slab will carry the deer until it
has passed the line of the axles, when its weight overbalances one
side, and the animal is precipitated into the pit. The slab then
comes back into a horizontal position as before, and is ready to
receive another deer. The animals are attracted by moss and lichens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
placed for them on the opposite side of the trap&mdash;in such a way that
they cannot be reached without crossing the slab. In this sort of
trap several deer are frequently caught during a single day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Norman knew another mode of hunting practised by the Esquimaux,
and proposed that the party should proceed in search of the herd
upon the following day; when, should they succeed in finding the
deer, he would show them how the thing was done; and he had no
doubt of their being able to make a good hunt of it. All agreed
to this proposal, as it would be of great importance to them to kill a
large number of these animals. It is true they had now provision
enough to serve for several days&mdash;but there were perhaps months, not
days, to be provided for. They believed that they could not be far
from the wooded countries near the banks of the Mackenzie, as some
kinds of the animal they had met with were only to be found near
timber during the winter season. But what of that? Even on the
banks of the great river itself they might not succeed in procuring
game. They resolved, therefore, to track the herd of deer which
Norman had seen; and for this purpose they agreed to make a stay
of some days at their present camp.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<div class="cap">A BATTLE WITH WOLVES.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">N</span>ext morning they were up by early daybreak. The days were
now only a few hours in length, for it was mid-winter, and they were
but three or four degrees south of the Arctic circle. Of course they
would require all the day for the intended hunt of the caribou, as
they might have to follow the track of the herd for many miles
before coming up with the animals. Lucien was to remain by the
camp, as it would never do to leave the animals they had already
killed without some guard. To have hung them on the trees, would
have put them out of the reach of both wolves and foxes; but the
lynx and wolverene are both tree-climbers, and could easily have
got at them there.</p>

<p>They had reason to believe there were wolverenes about; for these
fierce and destructive beasts are found in every part of the fur
countries&mdash;wherever there exist other animals upon which they can
prey. Eagles, hawks, and owls, moreover, would have picked the
partridges from the branches of the trees without difficulty. One
proposed burying them in the snow; but Norman assured them that
the Arctic foxes could scent them out, and dig them up in a few
minutes. Then it was suggested to cover them under a pile of
stones, as there were plenty of these lying about.</p>

<p>To this Norman also objected, saying that the wolverene could
pull off any stones they were able to pile upon them&mdash;as this creature
in its fore-legs possesses more than the strength of a man. Besides,
it was not unlikely that one of the great brown bears,&mdash;a species
entirely different from either the black or grizzly bears, and which
is only met with on the Barren Grounds&mdash;might come ranging that
way; and he could soon toss over any stone-heap they might build.
On the whole it was better that one of the four should remain by the
camp; and Lucien, who cared less about hunting than any of them,
willingly agreed to be the one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>Their arrangements were soon completed, and the three hunters
set out. They did not go straight towards the place where Norman
had found the deer upon the preceding day, but took a cross-cut
over the hills. This was by Norman's advice, who guided himself by
the wind&mdash;which had not changed since the previous day. He knew
that the caribou in feeding always travel <i>against</i> the wind; and he
expected therefore to find them somewhere in the direction from
which it was blowing. Following a course, which angled with that
of the wind, they kept on, expecting soon to strike the trail of the
herd.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lucien, left to himself, was not idle. He had to prepare
the flesh of the different animals, so as to render it fit to be carried
along. Nothing was required farther than to skin and cut them up.
Neither salting nor drying was necessary, for the flesh of one and all
had got frozen as stiff as a stone, and in this way it would keep
during the whole winter. The wolf was skinned with the others,
but this was because his fine skin was wanted. His flesh was not
intended to be eaten&mdash;although only a day or two before any one of
the party would have been glad of such a meal.</p>

<p>Not only the Indians, but the voyageurs and fur-traders, while
journeying through these inhospitable wilds, are often but too delighted
to get a dinner of wolf-meat. The ermine and the little
mouse were the only other creatures of the collection that were
deemed uneatable. As to the Arctic fox and the lynx, the flesh of
both these creatures is highly esteemed, and is white and tender,
almost as much so as the hares upon which they feed. The snowy
owl too, the jerfalcon, and the eagle, were looked upon as part of the
larder&mdash;the flesh of all being almost as good as that of the grouse.</p>

<p>Had it been a fishing eagle&mdash;such as the bald-head&mdash;the case would
have been different, for these last, on account of their peculiar food,
taste rank and disagreeable. But there was no danger of their
falling in with a fishing eagle at that place. These can only exist
where there is <i>open</i> water. Hence the cause of their annual migrations
to the southward, when the lakes and rivers of the fur countries
become covered with their winter ice.</p>

<p>Though Lucien remained quietly at the camp he was not without
adventures to keep him from wearying. While he was singeing his
grouse his eye happened to fall upon the shadow of a bird passing
over the snow. On looking up he saw a very large bird, nearly as
big as an eagle, flying softly about in wide circles. It was of a
mottled-brown colour; but its short neck and great round head told
the naturalist at a glance that it was a bird of the owl genus. It was
the largest of the kind that Lucien had ever seen, and was, in fact,
the largest known in America&mdash;the &ldquo;great cinereous owl.&rdquo; Now and
then it would alight upon a rock or tree, at the distance of an hundred
yards or so from the camp; where it would watch the operations
of Lucien, evidently inclined to help him in dissecting some of the
animals. Whenever he took up his gun and tried to approach
within shot, it would rise into the air again, always keeping out of
range. Lucien was provoked at this&mdash;for he wished, as a naturalist,
to examine the bird, and for this purpose to kill it, of course; but
the owl seemed determined that he should do no such thing.</p>

<p>At length, however, Lucien resolved upon a plan to decoy the
creature within shot. Taking up one of the grouse, he flung it out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
upon the snow some thirty yards from the fire. No sooner had he
done so, than the owl, at sight of the tempting morsel, left aside both
its shyness and prudence, and sailed gently forward; then, hovering
for a moment over the ground, hooked the grouse upon its claws, and
was about to carry it off, when a bullet from Lucien's rifle, just in
the &ldquo;nick of time,&rdquo; put a stop to its further flight, and dropped the
creature dead upon the snow.</p>

<p>Lucien picked it up and brought it to the camp, where he passed
some time in making notes upon its size, colour, and other peculiarities.
The owl measured exactly two feet in length from the point
of the bill to the end of the tail; and its &ldquo;alar spread,&rdquo; as naturalists
term it, was full five feet in extent. It was of a clove-brown colour,
beautifully mottled with white, and its bill and eyes were of a bright
gamboge yellow. Like all of its tribe that winter in the Arctic
wilds, it was feathered to the toes. Lucien reflected that this species
lives more in the woods than the &ldquo;great snowy owl,&rdquo; and, as he had
heard, is never found far out on the Barren Grounds during winter.
This fact, therefore, was a pleasant one to reflect upon, for it confirmed
the testimony which the travellers had already obtained from
several of the other creatures they had killed&mdash;that is to say, that
they must be in the neighbourhood of some timbered country.</p>

<p>Lucien had hardly finished his examination of the owl when he was
called upon to witness another incident of a still more exciting
nature. A hill, as already mentioned, or rather a ridge, rose up from
the opposite shore of the lake by which the camp was pitched. The
declivity of this hill fronted the lake, and sloped gradually back from
the edge of the water. Its whole face was smooth and treeless,
covered with a layer of pure snow. The camp commanded a full
view of it up to its very crest.</p>

<p>As Lucien was sitting quietly by the fire a singular sound, or
rather continuation of sounds, fell upon his ear. It somewhat
resembled the baying of hounds at a distance; and at first he was
inclined to believe that it was Marengo on a view-hunt after the
deer. On listening more attentively, however, he observed that the
sounds came from more than one animal; and also, that they bore
more resemblance to the howling of wolves than the deep-toned bay
of a bloodhound. This, in fact, it was; for the next moment a
caribou shot up over the crest of the hill, and was seen stretching at
full gallop down the smooth declivity in the direction of the lake.
Not twenty paces in its rear followed a string of howling animals,
evidently in pursuit of it. There were a dozen of them in all, and
they were running exactly like hounds upon the &ldquo;view holloa.&rdquo;
Lucien saw at a glance they were wolves. Most of them were
dappled-grey and white, while some were of a pure white colour.
Any one of them was nearly as large as the caribou itself; for in these
parts&mdash;around Great Slave Lake&mdash;the wolf grows to his largest size.</p>

<p>The caribou gained upon them as it bounded down the slope of the
hill. It was evidently making for the lake, believing, no doubt, that
the black ice upon its surface was water, and that in that element it
would have the advantage of its pursuers, for the caribou is a splendid
swimmer. Nearly all deer when hunted take to the water&mdash;to throw
off the dogs, or escape from men&mdash;and to this habit the reindeer
makes no exception.</p>

<p>Down the hill swept the chase, Lucien having a full view both of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
pursuers and pursued. The deer ran boldly. It seemed to have
gathered fresh confidence at sight of the lake, while the same object
caused its pursuers a feeling of disappointment. They knew they
were no match for a caribou in the water, as no doubt many a one
had escaped them in that element. It is not likely, however, that
they made reflections of this sort. There was but little time. From
the moment of their appearance upon the crest of the hill till the
chase arrived at the edge of the lake, was but a few seconds. On
reaching the shore the caribou made no stop; but bounded forward
in the same way as if it had been springing upon water. Most likely
it expected to hear a plunge; but, instead of that, its hoofs came
down upon the hard ice; and, by the impulse thus given, the animal
shot out with the velocity of a skater.</p>

<p>Strange to say, it still kept its feet; but, now seemingly overcome
by surprise, and knowing the advantage its pursuers would have
over it upon the slippery ice, it began to plunge and flounder, and
once or twice came to its knees. The hungry pursuers appeared to
recognise their advantage at once, for their howling opened with a
fresh burst, and they quickened their pace. Their sharp claws
enabled them to gallop over the ice at top speed; and one large
brute that led the pack soon came up with the deer, sprang upon it,
and bit it in the flank. This brought the deer upon its haunches,
and at once put an end to the chase. The animal was hardly down
upon the ice, when the foremost wolves coming up precipitated
themselves upon its body, and began to devour it.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the lake where the caribou had been
overtaken. At the time it first reached the ice, Lucien had laid hold
of his rifle and run forward in order to meet the animal half-way,
and, if possible, get a shot at it. Now that the creature was killed,
he continued on with the design of driving off the wolves, and securing
the carcass of the deer for himself. He kept along the ice until he
was within less than twenty yards of the pack, when, seeing that the
fierce brutes had torn the deer to pieces, and perceiving, moreover,
that they exhibited no fear of himself, he began to think he might
be in danger by advancing any nearer. Perhaps a shot from his rifle
would scatter them, and without further reflection he raised the
piece, and fired. One of the wolves kicked over upon the ice, and
lay quite dead; but the others, to Lucien's great surprise, instead of
being frightened off, immediately sprang upon their dead companion,
and commenced tearing and devouring it, just as they had done the
deer!</p>

<p>The sight filled Lucien with alarm; which was increased at seeing
several of the wolves&mdash;that had been beaten by the others from the
quarry&mdash;commence making demonstrations towards himself! Lucien
now trembled for his safety, and no wonder. He was near the middle
of the lake upon slippery ice. To attempt running back to the camp
would be hazardous; the wolves could overtake him before he had
got half-way, and he felt certain that any signs of fear on his part
would be the signal for the fierce brutes to assail him.</p>

<p>For some moments he was irresolute how to act. He had commenced
loading his gun, but his fingers were numbed with the cold,
and it was a good while before he could get the piece ready for a
second fire. He succeeded at length. He did not fire then, but
resolved to keep the charge for a more desperate crisis. Could he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
but reach the camp there were trees near it, and one of these he
might climb. This was his only hope, in case the wolves attacked
him, and he knew it was. Instead of turning and running for this
point, he began to back for it stealthily and with caution, keeping
his front all the while towards the wolves, and his eyes fixed upon
them.</p>

<p>He had not got many yards, when he perceived to his horror, that
the whole pack were in motion, and <i>coming after him</i>! It was a
terrible sight, and Lucien seeing that by retreating he only drew
them on, stopped and held his rifle in a threatening attitude. The
wolves were now within twenty yards of him; but, instead of moving
any longer directly towards him, they broke into two lines, swept
past on opposite sides of him, and then circling round, met each other
in his rear. <i>His retreat was cut off!</i></p>

<p>He now stood upon the ice with the fierce wolves forming a ring
around him, whose diameter was not the six lengths of his gun, and
every moment growing shorter and shorter. The prospect was
appalling. It would have caused the stoutest heart to quail, and
Lucien's was terrified. He shouted at the top of his voice. He fired
his rifle at the nearest. The brute fell, but the others showed no
symptoms of fear; they only grew more furious. Lucien clubbed his
gun&mdash;the last resort in such cases&mdash;and laid around him with all his
might; but he was in danger of slipping upon the ice, and his efforts
were feeble.</p>

<p>Once down he never would have risen again, for his fierce assailants
would have sprung upon him like tigers. As it was, he felt but little
hope. He believed himself lost. The teeth of the ferocious monsters
gleamed under his eyes. He was growing weaker and weaker, yet
still he battled on, and swept his gun around him with the energy of
despair.</p>

<p>Such a struggle could not have continued much longer. Lucien's
fate would have been sealed in a very few minutes more, had not
relief arrived in some shape or other. But it did come. A loud shout
was heard upon the hill; and Lucien, glancing suddenly towards it,
saw several forms rushing downward to the lake! It was the hunting
party returned, and in a moment more they were crossing the ice to
his rescue. Lucien gaining confidence fought with fresh vigour. The
wolves busy in their attack had either not heard or were regardless
of the new-comers; but the &ldquo;crack, crack&rdquo; of the guns&mdash;repeated no
less than four times&mdash;and then the nearer reports of pistols, made a
speedy impression upon the brutes, and in a short while half their
number were seen tumbling and kicking upon the ice. The rest,
uttering their hideous howls, took to flight, and soon disappeared
from the valley; and Lucien, half dead with fatigue, staggered into
the arms of his deliverers.</p>

<p>No less than seven of the wolves were killed in the affray&mdash;two of
which Lucien had shot himself. One or two were only wounded, but
so badly, that they could not get away; and these were handed over
to the tender mercies of Marengo, who amused himself for some time
after by worrying them to death.</p>

<p>The hunting party had made a good day of it. They had fallen in
with the caribou, and had killed three of them. These they were
bringing to camp, but had dropped them upon the hill, on perceiving
the perilous position of Lucien. They now went back, and having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
carried the deer to their camping-place, were soon engaged in the
pleasant occupation of eating a savoury dinner. Lucien soon recovered
from his fright and fatigue, and amused his companions by
giving an account of the adventures that had befallen him in their
absence.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<div class="cap">END OF THE &ldquo;VOYAGE.&rdquo;</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>ur party remained several days at this place, until they had made
a fresh stock of &ldquo;pemmican&rdquo; from the flesh of the caribou, several
more of which they succeeded in killing; and then, arranging everything
anew, and taking with them such skins as they wanted, they
continued their journey.</p>

<p>They had two days' hard travelling through a rocky mountainous
country, where they could not find a stick of wood to cook their meals
with, and were exposed to cold more than at any other place. Both
Fran&ccedil;ois and Lucien had their faces frost-bitten; but they were cured
by Norman, who prevented them from going near a fire until he had
well rubbed the parts with soft snow.</p>

<p>The rocks through which they passed were in many places covered
with the <i>tripe de roche</i> of several species; but our voyageurs cared
nothing about it so long as their pemmican lasted, and of that each
of them had nearly as much as he could carry.</p>

<p>In the most dreary part of the mountains they chanced upon
a herd of those curious animals, the musk-oxen, and shot one of
them; but the meat tasted so rank, and smelt so strongly of musk,
that the whole of it was left to the wolves, foxes, and other preying
creatures of these parts.</p>

<p>On the third day, after leaving their camp by the lake, a pleasant
prospect opened before them. It was the valley of the Mackenzie,
stretching to the west, and extending north and south as far as the
eye could reach, covered with forests of pine and poplar, and other
large trees. Of course the landscape was a winter one, as the river
was bound up in ice, and the trees themselves were half-white with
frozen snow; but after the dreary scenery of the barren grounds,
even this appeared warm and summer-like. There was no longer
any danger they should be without a good fire to cook their dinners,
or warm themselves at, and a wooded country offers a better prospect
of game.</p>

<p>The sight, therefore, of a great forest was cheering; and our
travellers, in high spirits, planted their tent upon the banks of the
great Northern river. They had still many hundred miles to go
before arriving at their destination; but they determined to continue
their journey without much delay, following the river as a guide.
No more &ldquo;near cuts&rdquo; were to be taken in future. They had learned,
from their recent experience, that &ldquo;the shortest way across is
sometimes the longest way round,&rdquo; and they resolved to profit by
the lesson. I hope, boy reader, you too will remember it.</p>

<p>After reaching the Mackenzie the voyageurs halted one day, and
upon the next commenced their journey down-stream. Sometimes
they kept upon the bank, but at times, for a change, they travelled
upon the ice of the river. There was no danger of its giving way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
under them, for it was more than a foot in thickness, and would
have supported a loaded wagon and horses, without even cracking.</p>

<p>They were now drawing near the Arctic circle, and the days grew
shorter and shorter as they advanced. But this did not much
interfere with their travelling. The long nights of the Polar regions
are not like those of more Southern latitudes. They are sometimes so
clear, that one may read the smallest print. What with the coruscations
of the aurora borealis, and the cheerful gleaming of the Northern
constellations, one may travel without difficulty throughout the livelong
night. I am sure, my young friend, you have made good use of
your globes, and need not be told that the length of both nights and
days, as you approach the pole, depends upon two things&mdash;the
latitude of the place, and the season of the year; and were you to
spend a whole year <i>leaning against the pole itself, (!)</i> you would <i>live
but one day and one night</i>&mdash;each of them six months in length.</p>

<p>But no doubt you know all these things without my telling you of
them, and you are impatient to hear not about that, but whether the
young voyageurs safely reached the end of their journey. That
question I answer briefly at once&mdash;they did.</p>

<p>Some distance below the point where they had struck the Mackenzie,
they fell in with a winter encampment of Dog-rib Indians.
Some of these people had been to the Fort to trade; and Norman
being known to them, he and his Southern cousins were received
with much hospitality. All their wants were provided for, as far as
it lay in the power of these poor people to do; but the most valuable
thing obtained from the Indians was a full set of dogs and dog-sledges
for the whole party. These were furnished by the chief,
upon the understanding that he should be paid for them on his next
visit to the Fort.</p>

<p>Although the reindeer of North America are not trained to the
sledge by the Esquimaux and Indians, several kinds of dogs are;
and a single pair of these faithful creatures will draw a full-grown
man at a rate that exceeds almost every other mode of travelling&mdash;steam
excepted. When our voyageurs, therefore, flung away their
snow-shoes, and, wrapped in their skin cloaks, seated themselves
snugly in their dog sledges, the five hundred miles that separated
them from the Fort were soon reduced to nothing; and one afternoon,
four small sledges, each carrying a &ldquo;young voyageur,&rdquo; with a large
bloodhound galloping in the rear, were seen driving up to the
stockade fence surrounding the Fort.</p>

<p>Before they had quite reached the gate, there was a general rush
of trappers, traders, voyageurs, <i>coureurs-des-bois</i> and other <i>employ&eacute;s</i>,
to reach them; and the next moment they were lost in the midst of
the people who crowded out of the Fort to welcome them. This was
their hour of happiness and joy.</p>

<p>To me there is an hour of regret, and I hope, boy reader, to you as
well&mdash;the hour of our parting with the &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Young Voyageurs</span>.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE BIGGEST WOOD IN THE WORLD.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">B</span>oy Reader, I am told that you are not tired of my company.
Is this true?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite true, dear Captain,&mdash;quite true!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is your reply. You speak sincerely? I believe you do.</p>

<p>In return, believe <i>me</i>, when I tell you I am not tired of yours; and
the best proof I can give is, that I have come once more to seek you.
I have come to solicit the pleasure of your company,&mdash;not to an
evening party, nor to a ball, nor to the Grand Opera, nor to the
Crystal Palace, nor yet to the Zoological Gardens of Regent's Park,&mdash;no,
but to the great zoological garden of Nature. I have come to
ask you to accompany me on another &ldquo;campaign,&rdquo;&mdash;another &ldquo;grand
journey&rdquo; through the fields of Science and Adventure. Will you go?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most willingly&mdash;with you, dear Captain, anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Come with me, then.</p>

<p>Again we turn our faces westward; again we cross the blue and
billowy Atlantic; again we seek the shores of the noble continent of
America.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! to America again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ha! that is a large continent, and you need not fear that I am
going to take you over old ground. No, fear not that! New scenes,
await us; a new <i>fauna</i>, a new <i>flora</i>,&mdash;I might almost say, a new
earth and a new sky!</p>

<p>You shall have variety, I promise you,&mdash;a perfect contrast to
the scenes of our last journey.</p>

<p>Then, you remember, we turned our faces to the cold and icy
North,&mdash;now our path lies through the hot and sunny South. Then
we lived in a log-hut, and closed every cranny to keep out the cold,&mdash;now,
in our cottage of palms and cane, we shall be but too glad to let
the breeze play through the open walls. Then we wrapped our
bodies in thick furs,&mdash;now we shall be content with the lightest
garments. Then we were bitten by the frost&mdash;now we shall be
bitten by the sand-flies, and mosquitoes, and bats, and snakes, and
scorpions, and spiders, and stung by wasps, and centipedes, and
great red ants! Trust me, you shall have a change!</p>

<p>Perhaps you do not contemplate <i>such</i> a change with any very lively
feelings of pleasure. Come! do not be alarmed at the snakes, and
scorpions, and centipedes! We shall find a cure for every bite&mdash;an
antidote for every bane.</p>

<p>Our new journey shall have its pleasures and advantages. Remember
how of old we shivered as we slept, coiled up in the corner
of our dark log-hut and smothered in skins,&mdash;now we shall swing
lightly in our netted hammocks under the gossamer leaves of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
palm-tree, or the feathery frondage of the ferns. Then we gazed
upon leaden skies, and at night looked upon the cold constellation of
the Northern Bear;&mdash;now, we shall have over us an azure canopy,
and shall nightly behold the sparkling glories of the Southern Cross,
still shining as bright as when Paul and his little Virginia with
loving eyes gazed upon it from their island home. In our last journey
we toiled over bleak and barren wastes, across frozen lakes, and
marshes, and rivers;&mdash;now we shall pass under the shadows of virgin
forests, and float lightly upon the bosom of broad majestic streams,
whose shores echo with the voices of living nature.</p>

<p>Hitherto our travels have been upon the wide, open prairie, the
trackless plain of sand, the frozen lake, the thin scattering woods of
the North, or the treeless snow-clad &ldquo;Barrens.&rdquo; Now we are about
to enter a great forest,&mdash;a forest where the leaves never fade, where
the flowers are always in bloom,&mdash;a forest where the woodman's axe
has not yet echoed, where the colonist has hardly hewed out a single
clearing,&mdash;a vast primeval forest,&mdash;the largest in the world.</p>

<p>How large, do you ask? I can hardly tell you. Are you thinking
of Epping or the New Forest? True, these are large woods, and have
been larger at one time. But if you draw your ideas of a great forest
from either of these you must prepare yourselves for a startling
announcement&mdash;and that is, that the forest through which I am
going to take you is <i>as big as all Europe</i>! There is one place where
a straight line might be drawn across this forest that would measure
the enormous length of two thousand six hundred miles! And there
is a point in it from which a circle might be described, with a
diameter of more than a thousand miles, and the whole area included
within the vast circumference would be found covered with an unbroken
forest!</p>

<p>I need scarce tell you what forest I allude to, for there is none
other in the world of such dimensions&mdash;none to compare with that
vast, trackless forest that covers the valley of the mighty Amazon!</p>

<p>And what shall we see in travelling through this tree-covered
expanse? Many a strange form of life&mdash;both vegetable and animal.
We shall see the giant &ldquo;ceiba&rdquo; tree, and the &ldquo;zamang,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;caoba,&rdquo; twined by huge parasites almost as thick as their own
trunks, and looking as though they embraced but to crush them; the
&ldquo;juvia,&rdquo; with its globe-shaped fruits as large as the human head; the
&ldquo;cow-tree,&rdquo; with its abundant fountains of rich milk; the &ldquo;seringa,&rdquo;
with its valuable gum&mdash;the caoutchouc of commerce; the &ldquo;cinchona,&rdquo;
with its fever-killing bark; the curious &ldquo;volador,&rdquo; with its winged
seeds; the wild indigo, and the arnatto. We shall see palms of many
species&mdash;some with trunks smooth and cylindrical, others covered
with thorns, sharp and thickly set&mdash;some with broad entire leaves,
others with fronds pinnate and feathery, and still others whose
leaves are the shape of a fan&mdash;some rising like naked columns to the
height of an hundred and fifty feet, while others scarcely attain to
the standard of an ordinary man.</p>

<p>On the water we shall see beautiful lilies&mdash;the snow-white <i>nymphs</i>,
and the yellow <i>nuphars</i>. We shall see the <i>Victoria regia</i> covering the
pool with its massive wax-like flowers, and huge circular leaves of
bronze green. We shall see tall flags like Saracen spears, and the
dark green culms of gigantic rushes, and the golden <i>arundinaria</i>&mdash;the
bamboo, and &ldquo;ca&ntilde;a brava,&rdquo;&mdash;that rival the forest trees in height.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>Many a form of animal life we may behold. Basking in the sun,
we may behold the yellow and spotted body of the jaguar&mdash;a beautiful
but dreaded sight. Breaking through the thick underwood, or
emerging slowly from the water, we may catch a glimpse of the
sombre tapir, or the red-brown capivara. We may see the ocelot
skulking through the deep shade, or the margay springing upon its
winged prey.</p>

<p>We may see the shaggy ant-bear tearing at the cones of sand-clay,
and licking up the white termites; or we may behold the scaly
armadillo crawling over the sun-parched earth, and rolling itself up
at the approach of danger. We may see human-like forms,&mdash;the
<i>quadrumana</i>&mdash;clinging among the high branches, and leaping from
tree to tree, like birds upon the wing; we may see them of many
shapes, sizes, and colours, from the great howling monkeys, with their
long prehensive tails, down to the little saimiris and ouistitis not
larger than squirrels.</p>

<p>What beautiful birds, too!&mdash;for this forest is their favourite home.
Upon the ground, the large curassows, and gurns, and the &ldquo;gallo,&rdquo;
with his plumage of bright red. Upon the trees, the macaws, and
parrots, and toucans, and trogons. In the waters, the scarlet
flamingoes, the ibises, and the tall herons; and in the air, the hawks,
the zamuros, the king-vultures, and the eagles.</p>

<p>We shall see much of the reptile world, both by land and water.
Basking upon the bank, or floating along the stream, we may behold
the great water lizards&mdash;the crocodile and ca&iuml;man; or the unwieldly
forms of the <i>cheloni&aelig;</i>&mdash;the turtles. Nimbly running along the tree-trunk,
or up the slanting lliana, we may see the crested iguana,
hideous to behold. On the branches that overhang the silent pool
we may see the &ldquo;water-boa,&rdquo; of huge dimensions, watching for his
prey&mdash;the peccary, the capivara, the paca, or the agouti; and in the
dry forest we may meet with his congener the &ldquo;stag-swallower,&rdquo;
twined around a tree, and waiting for the roebuck or the little red-deer
of the woods.</p>

<p>We may see the mygale, or bird-catching spider, at the end of his
strong net-trap, among the thick foliage; and the tarantula, at the
bottom of his dark pit-fall, constructed in the ground. We may see
the tent-like hills of the white ants, raised high above the surface,
and the nests of many other kinds, hanging from high branches, and
looking as though they had been constructed out of raw silk and
pasteboard. We may see trees covered with these nests, and some
with the nests of wasps, and still others with those of troupials and
orioles&mdash;birds of the genus <i>icterus</i> and <i>cassicus</i>&mdash;hanging down like
long cylindrical purses.</p>

<p>All those, and many more strange sights, may be seen in the great
forest of the Amazon valley; and some of them we <i>shall</i> see&mdash;<i>voil&agrave;</i>!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE REFUGEES.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">U</span>pon a bright and lovely evening, many years ago, a party of
travellers might have been seen climbing up that Cordillera of the
Andes that lies to the eastward of the ancient city of Cuzco. It was
a small and somewhat singular party of travellers; in fact, a travelling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
family,&mdash;father, mother, children, and one attendant. We shall
say a word of each of them separately.</p>

<p>The chief of the party was a tall and handsome man, of nearly forty
years of age. His countenance bespoke him of Spanish race, and so
he was. He was not a Spaniard, however, but a Spanish-American,
or &ldquo;Creole,&rdquo; for so Spaniards born in America are called to distinguish
them from the natives of Old Spain.</p>

<p>Remember&mdash;Creoles are <i>not</i> people with negro or African blood in
their veins. There is a misconception on this head in England, and
elsewhere. The African races of America are either negroes, mulattoes,
quadroons, quinteroons, or mestizoes; but the &ldquo;Creoles&rdquo; are of
European blood, though born in America. Remember this. Don
Pablo Romero&mdash;for that was the name of our traveller&mdash;was a Creole,
a native of Cuzco, which, as you know, was the ancient capital of the
Incas of Peru.</p>

<p>Don Pablo, as already stated, was nearly forty years of age. Perhaps
he looked older. His life had not been spent in idleness.
Much study, combined with a good deal of suffering and care, had
made many of those lines that rob the face of its youthful appearance.
Still, although his look was serious, and just then sad, his eye was
occasionally seen to brighten, and his light elastic step showed that
he was full of vigour and manhood. He had a moustache, very full
and black, but his whiskers were clean shaven, and his hair cut short,
after the fashion of most people in Spanish America.</p>

<p>He wore velvet pantaloons, trimmed at the bottoms with black
stamped leather, and upon his feet were strong boots of a reddish
yellow colour&mdash;that is, the natural colour of the tanned hide before it
has been stained. A dark jacket, closely buttoned, covered the upper-part
of his body, and a scarlet silk sash encircled his waist, the long
fringed ends hanging down over the left hip. In this sash were
stuck a Spanish knife and a pair of pistols, richly ornamented with
silver mountings.</p>

<p>But all these things were concealed from the view by a capacious
poncho, which is a garment that in South America serves as a cloak
by day and a blanket by night. It is nearly of the size and shape of
an ordinary blanket, with a slit in the centre, through which the
head is passed, leaving the ends to hang down. Instead of being of
uniform colour, several bright colours are usually woven into the
poncho, forming a variety of patterns. In Mexico a very similar
garment&mdash;the serap&eacute;&mdash;is almost universally worn. The poncho of
Don Pablo was a costly one, woven by hand, and out of the finest
wool of the vicu&ntilde;a, for that is the native country of this useful and
curious animal.</p>

<p>Such a poncho would cost 20<i>l.</i>, and would not only keep out cold,
but would turn rain like a &ldquo;macintosh.&rdquo; Don Pablo's hat was also
curious and costly. It was one of those known as &ldquo;Panama,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Guayaquil,&rdquo;&mdash;hats so called because they are manufactured by
Indian tribes who dwell upon the Pacific coast, and are made out
of a rare sea-grass, which is found near the above-mentioned places.
A good Guayaquil hat will cost 20<i>l.</i>; and although, with its broad
curling brim and low crown, it looks not much better than Leghorn
or even fine straw, yet it is far superior to either, both as a protection
against rain, or, what is of more importance in southern countries,
against a hot tropical sun. The best of them will wear half a life-time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Don Pablo's &ldquo;sombrero&rdquo; was one of the very best and
costliest; and this, combined with the style of his other habiliments,
betokened that the wearer was one of the &ldquo;ricos,&rdquo; or high class of
his country.</p>

<p>The costume of his wife, who was a dark and very beautiful
Spanish woman, would have strengthened this idea. She wore a
dress of black silk with velvet bodice and sleeves, tastefully embroidered.
A mantilla of dark cloth covered her shoulders, and on
her head was a low broad-brimmed hat, similar to those usually worn
by men, for a bonnet is a thing unknown to the ladies of Spanish
America. A single glance at the Do&ntilde;a Isidora would have satisfied
any one that she was a lady of rank and refinement.</p>

<p>There were two children, upon which, from time to time, she gazed
tenderly. They were her only ones. They were a boy and girl,
nearly of equal size and age. The boy was the elder, perhaps thirteen
or more, a handsome lad, with swarth face, coal-black eyes, and
curly full-flowing dark hair. The girl, too, who would be about
twelve, was dark&mdash;that is to say, brunette in complexion. Her eyes
were large, round, and dreamy, with long lashes that kept the sun
from shining into them, and thus deepened their expression.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are no children in the world so beautiful as those of
the Spanish race. There is a smoothness of skin, a richness in colour,
and a noble &ldquo;hidalgo&rdquo; expression in their round black eyes that is
rare in other countries. Spanish women retain this expression to a
good age. The men lose it earlier, because, as I believe, they are
oftener of corrupted morals and habits; and these, long exercised,
certainly stamp their lines upon the face. Those which are mean,
and low, and vicious, produce a similar character of countenance,
while those which are high, and holy, and virtuous, give it an aspect
of beauty and nobility.</p>

<p>Of all beautiful Spanish children none could have been more
beautiful than our two little Creole Spaniards, Leon and Leona&mdash;for
such were the names of the brother and sister.</p>

<p>There yet remains one to be described, ere we complete the account
of our travelling party. This one was a grown and tall man, quite
as tall as Don Pablo himself, but thinner and more angular in his
outlines. His coppery colour, his long straight black hair, his dark
and wild piercing eye, with his somewhat odd attire, told you at
once he was of a different race from any of the others. He was an
Indian&mdash;a South American Indian; and although a descendant from
the noble race of the Peruvian Incas, he was acting in the capacity
of a servant or attendant to Don Pablo and his family.</p>

<p>There was a familiarity, however, between the old Indian&mdash;for he
was an old man&mdash;and Don Pablo, that bespoke the existence of some
tie of a stronger nature than that which exists between master and
servant. And such there was in reality. This Indian had been one
of the patriots who had rallied around Tupac Amaru in his revolution
against the Spaniards. He had been proscribed, captured, and
sentenced to death. He would have been executed, but for the
interference of Don Pablo, who had saved his life. Since then Guapo&mdash;such
was the Indian's name&mdash;had remained not only the retainer,
but the firm and faithful friend, of his benefactor.</p>

<p>Guapo's feet were sandalled. His legs were naked up to the knees,
showing many an old scar received from the cactus plants and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
thorny bushes of acacia, so common in the mountain-valleys of Peru.
A tunic-like skirt of woollen cloth,&mdash;that home-made sort called
&ldquo;bayeta,&rdquo;&mdash;was fastened around his waist, and reached down to the
knees; but the upper part of his body was quite bare, and you could
see the naked breast and arms, corded with strong muscles, and
covered with a skin of a dark copper colour. The upper part of his
body was naked only when the sun was hot. At other times Guapo
wore a species of poncho like his master, but that of the Indian was
of common stuff&mdash;woven out of the coarse wool of the llama. His
head was bare.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/illus-167.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="THE FLIGHT OF THE REFUGEES." title="THE FLIGHT OF THE REFUGEES." />
<span class="caption">THE FLIGHT OF THE REFUGEES.</span></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>Guapo's features were thin, sharp, and intelligent. His eye was
keen and piercing; and the gait of the old man, as he strode along
the rocky path, told that it would be many years before he would
show any signs of feebleness or tottering.</p>

<p>There were four animals that carried our travellers and their
effects. One was a horse ridden by the boy Leon. The second was
a saddle mule, on which rode Do&ntilde;a Isidora and Leona. The other
two animals were not mounted. They were beasts of burden, with
&ldquo;yerguas,&rdquo; or pack-saddles, upon which were carried the few articles
that belonged to the travellers. They were the camels of Peru&mdash;the
far-famed llamas. Don Pablo, with his faithful retainer, travelled
afoot.</p>

<p>You will wonder that one apparently so rich, and on so distant a
journey, was not provided with animals enough to carry his whole
party. Another horse at least, or a mule, might have been expected
in the cavalcade. It would not have been strange had Guapo only
walked&mdash;as he was the arriero, or driver, of the llamas&mdash;but to see
Don Pablo afoot and evidently tired, with neither horse nor mule to
ride upon, was something that required explanation. There was
another fact that required explanation. The countenance of Don
Pablo wore an anxious expression, as if some danger impended; so
did that of the lady, and the children were silent, with their little
hearts full of fear. They knew not <i>what</i> danger, but they knew that
their father and mother were in trouble.</p>

<p>The Indian, too, had a serious look; and at each angle of the
mountain road he and Don Pablo would turn around, and with
anxious eyes gaze back in the direction that led towards Cuzco. As
yet they could distinguish the spires of the distant city, and the
Catholic crosses, as they glistened under the evening sunbeam. Why
did they look back with fear and distrust? Why? <i>Because Don
Pablo was in flight, and feared pursuers!</i> What? Had he committed
some great crime? No. On the contrary, he was the <i>victim of a noble
virtue</i>&mdash;the virtue of patriotism! For that had he been condemned,
and was now in flight&mdash;flying to save not only his liberty but his
life! yes, <i>his life;</i> for had the sentinels on those distant towers but
recognised him, he would soon have been followed and dragged back
to an ignominious death.</p>

<p>Young reader, I am writing of things that occurred before the
Spanish-American colonies became free from the rule of Old Spain.
You will remember that these countries were then governed by
viceroys, who represented the King of Spain, but who in reality were
quite as absolute as that monarch himself. The great viceroys of
Mexico and Peru held court in grand state, and lived in the midst of
barbaric pomp and luxury. The power of life and death was in their
hands, and in many instances they used it in the most unjust and
arbitrary manner. They were themselves, of course, natives of Old
Spain&mdash;often the pampered favourites of that corrupt court.</p>

<p>All the officials by which they were surrounded and served were,
like themselves, natives of Spain, or &ldquo;Gachupinos,&rdquo; (as the Creoles
used to call them,) while the Creoles&mdash;no matter how rich, or learned,
or accomplished in any way&mdash;were excluded from every office of
honour and profit. They were treated by the Gachupinos with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
contempt and insult. Hence for long, long years before the great
revolutions of Spanish America, a strong feeling of dislike existed
between Creole Spaniards and Spaniards of Old Spain; and this
feeling was quite independent of that which either had towards the
Indians&mdash;the aborigines of America. This feeling brought about the
revolution, which broke out in all the countries of Spanish America
(including Mexico) and which, after fifteen years of cruel and sanguinary
fighting, led to the independence of these countries.</p>

<p>Some people will tell you that they gained nothing by this independence,
as since that time so much war and anarchy have marked
their history. There is scarcely any subject upon which mankind
thinks more superficially, and judges more wrongly, than upon this
very one. It is a mistake to suppose that a people enjoys either
peace or prosperity, simply because it is quiet. There is quiet in
Russia, but to its millions of serfs war continuous and eternal; and
the same may be said of many other countries as well as Russia.</p>

<p>To the poor slave, or even to the over-taxed subject, peace is no
peace, but a constant and systematised struggle, often more pernicious
in its effects than even the anarchy of open war. A war of
this kind numbers its slain by millions, for the victims of famine are
victims of <i>political crime</i> on the part of a nation's rulers. I have no
time now to talk of these things. Perhaps, boy reader, you and I
may meet on this ground again, and at no very distant period.</p>

<p>Well, it was not in the general rising that Don Pablo had been
compromised, but previous to that. The influence of the European
Revolution of 1798 was felt even in distant Spanish America, and
several ebullitions occurred in different parts of that country at
the same time. They were premature; they were crushed. Those
who had taken part in them were hunted to the death. Death!
death! was the war-cry of the Spanish hirelings, and bitterly did they
execute their vengeance on all who were compromised. Don Pablo
would have been a victim among others, had he not had timely
warning and escaped; but as it was, all his property was taken by
confiscation, and became the plunder of the rapacious tyrant.</p>

<p>We are introduced to him just at the period of his escape. By the
aid of the faithful Guapo he had hastily collected a few things, and
with his wife and family fled in the night. Hence the incompleteness
of his travelling equipage. He had taken one of the most unfrequented
paths&mdash;a mere bridle-road&mdash;that led from Cuzco eastward
over the Cordillera. His intent was to gain the eastern slope of the
Andes mountains, where he might conceal himself for a time in the
uninhabited woods of the Great <i>Monta&ntilde;a</i>, and towards this point
was he journeying. By a <i>ruse</i> he had succeeded in putting the
soldiers of the despot on a false track; but it was not certain that
they might not yet fall into the true one. No wonder then, when
he gazed back towards Cuzco, that his look was one of apprehension
and anxiety.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE POISON-TREES.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">F</span>ollowing the rugged and winding path, the travellers had climbed
to a height of many thousand feet above the ocean level. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
very little vegetation around them. Nothing that deserved the
name of tree, if we except a few stunted specimens of que&ntilde;oa trees,
and here and there patches of the Ratanhia shrub, which covered
the hill-sides. Both these are used by the mountain Indians as fuel,
but the Ratanhia is also a favourite remedy against dysentery and
blood-spitting. Its extract is even exported to European countries,
and is to be found in the shop of the apothecary.</p>

<p>Now and then a beautiful species of locust was seen with its bright
red flowers. It was the &ldquo;Sangre de Christo&rdquo; of the Peruvian <i>flora</i>.</p>

<p>Don Pablo Romero was a naturalist, and I may here tell you a
pleasant and interesting fact&mdash;which is, that many of the earliest
patriots and revolutionists of Spanish America were men who had
distinguished themselves in natural science&mdash;in fact, were the &ldquo;savans&rdquo;
of these countries. I call this a pleasant fact, and you may deem it
a curious one too, because men of science are usually lovers of peace,
and not accustomed to meddle either in war or politics.</p>

<p>But the truth of the matter is this,&mdash;under the government of the
viceroys all books, except those of a monkish religion, were jealously
excluded from these countries. No political work whatever was
permitted to be introduced; and the people were kept in the grossest
ignorance of their natural rights. It was only into learned institutions
that a glimmering of the light of freedom found its way, and
it was amongst the professors of these institutions that the &ldquo;rights
of men&rdquo; first began to be discussed. Many of these noble patriots
were the first victims offered up on the altar of Spanish-American
independence.</p>

<p>Don Pablo, I have said, was a naturalist; and it was perhaps the
first journey he had ever made without observing attentively the
natural objects that presented themselves along his route. But his
mind was busy with other cares; and he heeded neither the <i>fauna</i>
nor <i>flora</i>. He thought only of his loved wife and dear children, of
the dangers to which he and they were exposed. He thought only
of increasing the distance between them and his vengeful enemies.
During that day they had made a toilsome journey of fifteen miles,
up the mountain&mdash;a long journey for the llamas, who rarely travel
more than ten or twelve; but the dumb brutes seemed to exert themselves
as if they knew that danger threatened those who guided
them.</p>

<p>They belonged to Guapo, who had not been a mere servant, but a
cultivator, and had held a small &ldquo;chacra,&rdquo; or farm, under Don Pablo.
Guapo's voice was well known to the creatures, and his &ldquo;hist!&rdquo; of
encouragement urged them on. But fifteen miles was an unusual
journey, and the animals began to show symptoms of fatigue.
Their humming noise, which bears some resemblance to the tones of
an Eolian harp, boomed loud at intervals as the creatures came to a
stop; and then the voice of Guapo could be heard urging them
forward.</p>

<p>The road led up a defile, which was nothing more than the bed
of a mountain-torrent, now dry. For a long distance there was no
spot of level ground where our travellers could have encamped, even
had they desired to stop. At length, however, the path led out of
the torrent-bed, and they found themselves on a small ledge, or
table, covered with low trees. These trees were of a peculiar kind,
very common in all parts of the Andes, and known as <i>moll&eacute;</i> trees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
They are more properly bushes than trees, being only about ten or
twelve feet in height. They have long delicate pinnate leaves, very
like those of the acacia, and, when in fruit, they are thickly covered
with clusters of small bright red berries.</p>

<p>These berries are used among some tribes of Indians for making a
highly valuable and medicinal beer; but the wood of the tree is of
more importance to the people of those parts as an article of fuel,
because the tree grows where other wood is scarce. It is even considered
by the sugar-refiners as the best for their purpose, since its
ashes, possessing highly alkaline properties, are more efficient than
any other in purifying the boiling juice of the sugar-cane. The
leaves of this beautiful tree, when pressed, emit a strong aromatic
smell; and a very curious property ascribed to it by the more
ignorant people of the mountains will be illustrated by the dialogue
which follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us pass the night here,&rdquo; said Don Pablo, halting, and addressing
himself to Guapo. &ldquo;This level spot will serve us to encamp.
We can sleep under the shade of the bushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! <i>mi amo</i>! (my master) Here?&rdquo; replied the Indian, with a
gesture of surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not here? Can any place be better? If we again enter
the defile we may find no other level spot. See! the llamas will go
no farther. We must remain therefore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, master,&rdquo; continued Guapo&mdash;&ldquo;see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trees, master!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what of the trees? Their shade will serve to screen us from
the night dew. We can sleep under them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible, master&mdash;<i>they are poison trees</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are talking foolishly, Guapo. These are <i>moll&eacute;</i> trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, se&ntilde;or; but they are poison. If we sleep under them
we shall not awake in the morning&mdash;we shall awake no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Guapo, as he uttered these words, looked horrified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is nonsense; you are superstitious, old man. We must abide
here. See, the llamas have lain down. They will not move hence,
I warrant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guapo turned to the llamas, and thinking that their movements
might influence the decision of his master, began to urge them in his
accustomed way. But it is a peculiarity of these creatures not to stir
one step beyond what they consider a proper journey. Even when
the load is above that which they are accustomed to carry&mdash;that is to
say, 120 lbs.&mdash;neither voice nor whip will move them. They may be
goaded to death, but will not yield, and coaxing has a like effect.
Both knew that they had done their day's work; and the voice, the
gesticulations and blows of Guapo, were all in vain. Neither would
obey him any longer. The Indian saw this, and reluctantly consented
to remain; at the same time he continued to repeat his belief that
they would all most certainly perish in the night. For himself, he
expressed his intention to climb a ledge, and sleep upon the naked
rocks; and he earnestly entreated the others to follow his example.</p>

<p>Don Pablo listened to the admonitions of his retainer with incredulity,
though not with any degree of disdain. He knew the
devotedness of the old Indian, and therefore treated, what he considered
a mere superstition, with a show of respect. But he felt an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
inclination to cure Guapo of the folly of such a belief; and was, on
this account, the more inclined to put his original design into
execution. To pass the night under the shade of the moll&eacute; trees
was, therefore, determined upon.</p>

<p>All dismounted. The llamas were unloaded; their packs, or <i>yerguas</i>,
taken off; the horse and mule were unsaddled; and all were permitted
to browse over the little space which the ledge afforded.
They were all trained animals. There was no fear of any of them
straying.</p>

<p>The next thing was to prepare supper. All were hungry, as none
of the party had eaten since morning. In the hurry of flight, they
had made no provision for an extended journey. A few pieces of
<i>charqui</i> (jerked or dried beef) had been brought along; and, in
passing near a field of &ldquo;oca,&rdquo; Guapo had gathered a bunch of the
roots, and placed them on the back of his llama. This oca is a
tuberous root, of an oval shape and pale red colour, but white inside.
It resembles very much the Jerusalem artichoke, but it is longer and
slimmer. Its taste is very agreeable and sweetish&mdash;somewhat like
that of pumpkins, and it is equally good when roasted or boiled.</p>

<p>There is another sort of tuberous root, called &ldquo;ulluca&rdquo; by the
Peruvians, which is more glutinous and less pleasant to the taste.
This kind is various in form, being either round, oblong, straight, or
curved, and of a reddish, yellow colour outside, though green within.
It is insipid when boiled with water, but excellent when dressed with
Spanish peppers (<i>Capsicum</i>). Out of the <i>oca</i>, then, and <i>charqui</i>, the
supper must be made; and for the purpose of cooking it, a fire must
be kindled with the wood of the moll&eacute;.</p>

<p>For a long time there was a doubt about whether it would be safe
to kindle this fire. The sun had not yet gone down, and the smoke
might attract observation from the valley below. If the pursuers
were on their track, it might be noticed; as upon this lonely route
a fire would indicate nothing else than the camp of some one on a
journey. But the stomachs of our travellers cried for food, and it
was at length resolved to light the fire, but not until after sunset,
when the smoke could be no longer seen, and the blaze would be
hidden behind the thick bushes of moll&eacute;.</p>

<p>Don Pablo walked off from the camp, and wandered among the
trees to see if he could find something that might contribute a little
variety to their simple supper. A small, broom-like plant, that grew
among the moll&eacute; trees, soon attracted his attention. This was the
<i>quinoa</i> plant, which produces a seed, not unlike rice, though smaller
in the grain, whence it has received in commerce the name &ldquo;petty
rice.&rdquo; The quinoa seeds, when boiled, are both pleasant and nutritious,
but especially so when boiled in milk. Previous to the discovery
of America, &ldquo;quinoa&rdquo; was an article of food, supplying the place of
wheat. It was much used by the natives, and is still collected for
food in many parts. Indeed, it has been introduced into some
European countries, and cultivated with success. The leaves, when
young, can be used as spinach, but the seeds are the most sought
after for food.</p>

<p>Don Pablo having called Leon to assist him, a quantity of the seeds
were soon collected into a vessel, and carried to the place which they
had chosen for their camp; and, as it was now dark enough, the fire
was kindled and the cooking-pot got ready. The Do&ntilde;a Isidora,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
although a fine lady, was one of those who had all her life been
accustomed to look after her household affairs; and this, it may be
remarked, is a somewhat rare virtue among the Peruvian ladies, who
are generally too much given to dress and idleness. It was not so,
however, with the wife of Don Pablo. She knew how to look after
the affairs of the <i>cuisine</i>, and could dress any of the peculiar dishes of
the country with the best of cooks. In a short while, therefore, an
excellent supper was ready, of which all ate heartily, and then,
wrapping themselves up in their ponchos, lay down to sleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE SUPPER OF GUAPO.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span> have said all ate of the supper. This is not strictly true. One of
the party did not touch it, and that was old Guapo. Why? Was he
not hungry like the rest? Yes; as hungry as any of them. Why
then did he not eat of the <i>charqui</i> and ocas? Simply because Guapo
had a supper of a very different kind, which he carried in his pouch,
and which he liked much better than the charqui stew. What was
it? It was &ldquo;coca.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chocolate,&rdquo; you will say, or, as some call it, &ldquo;cocoa,&rdquo; which should
be called, to name it properly, &ldquo;cacao.&rdquo; No, I answer&mdash;it was not
chocolate, nor cocoa, nor cacao neither.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been cocoa-nuts then?&rdquo; No; nor yet cocoa-nuts.
The &ldquo;coca,&rdquo; upon which Guapo made his supper, and which contented
his stomach perfectly for the night, was an article very different from
either the cacao which makes chocolate, or the nut of the cocoa-palm.
You are now impatient to hear what sort of thing it was, and I shall
tell you at once.</p>

<p>The coca is a small tree or shrub about six feet in height, which
grows in the warmer valleys among the Andes mountains. Its
botanical name is <i>Erythroxylon coca</i>. Its leaves are small and of a
bright green colour, and its blossoms white. Its fruits are very small
scarlet berries. It is a native plant, and, therefore, found in a wild
state; but it is cultivated by the planters of these countries in fields
regularly laid out, and hence called &ldquo;cocales.&rdquo; This plant is raised
from the seed, and when the young shoots have attained the height
of about eighteen inches, they are transplanted and put down again
at the distance of about a foot apart from each other.</p>

<p>Now as these little bushes require a humid atmosphere, maize-plants
are sown between the rows to protect them from the sun. In
other places arbours of palm-leaves are constructed over the coca-plants.
When no rain falls, they are watered every five or six days.
After about two and a half years of this nursing, the coca-bush is
ready for use, and it is the leaves alone that are valuable. These are
gathered with great care, just as the Chinese gather the leaves of the
tea-plant; and, as in China, women are principally employed in this
labour. The leaves are said to be ripe, not when they have withered
and turned brown, but at a period when they are full-grown and
become brittle. When this period arrives, they are picked from the
tree, and laid out on coarse woollen cloths to dry in the sun.</p>

<p>When dried, they remain of a pale green colour; but should they
get damp during the process, they become darker, and are then of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
inferior quality, and sell for a less price. When fully dried, they are
carefully packed in bags and covered up with dry sand, and are thus
ready for the market. Their price, on the spot where the crop is
produced, is about one shilling English per pound. They are, therefore,
full as costly to produce as tea itself, although the coca-bush will
yield three crops of leaves in one year&mdash;that is, a crop every four
months; and one hundred plants will produce about an arroba (25 lbs.)
at a crop. The coca-plant will continue to give fresh leaves for a
long period of years, unless attacked and destroyed by ants, which is
not unfrequently the case.</p>

<p>Now, why have I so minutely described the coca-bush? Because,
that, in the economy of the life of those Indians who inhabit the
countries of the Andes mountains, this curious plant plays a most
important part. Scarcely one of these people is to be met with who
is not an eater of cocoa&mdash;a &ldquo;coquero.&rdquo; With them it is what the tea-tree
is to the Chinese. Indeed, it is a curious fact, that in all parts
of the world some stimulating vegetable is used by the human race.
Tea in China; the betel-leaf, and the nut of the areca palm, among
the Southern Asiatics; the poppy in the East; with tobacco, and
many like things, in other countries.</p>

<p>But the coca not only supplies the Indian with a solace to his
cares, it forms the chief article of his food. With a supply of coca,
an Indian will support himself five or six days without eating anything
else. The poor miners, in the Peruvian mines, are all
&ldquo;coqueros;&rdquo; and it is alleged that, without coca, they would be
unable to undergo the painful toil to which their calling subjects
them. When used to excess, the coca produces deleterious effects
on the human system; but, if moderately taken, it is far more
innocent in its results than either opium or tobacco.</p>

<p>The coca-leaf is not eaten alone. A certain preparation is
necessary, and another substance is mixed with it before it produces
the proper effect. But let us watch the movements of Guapo, and we
shall see how <i>he</i> does it, for Guapo is a confirmed coquero.</p>

<p>Guapo, true to his promise, does not sleep under the moll&eacute; trees.
He leaves the party, and, with a melancholy air, has climbed up and
seated himself upon a projecting rock, where he intends to pass the
night. His last glance at Don Pablo and his family was one of foreboding.
He had again remonstrated with his master, but to no
purpose. The latter only laughed at the earnestness of the old
Indian, and told him to go to his perch and leave the party to themselves.</p>

<p>It was still grey light when Guapo climbed up to the rock. Against
the sky his tall, lank form could be traced in all its outlines. For
some moments he sat in a serious and reflective mood&mdash;evidently
busy with thoughts about the &ldquo;poison-trees.&rdquo; His appetite, however,
soon got the better of him; and he set to work to prepare his
coca supper. It was a simple operation.</p>

<p>Around Guapo's neck there hung a small pouch made of the skin
of the chinchilla, which beautiful little animal is a native of these
parts. This pouch contained a quantity of the dry leaves of the coca.
Having taken out some half-dozen of these leaves, he put them into
his mouth and commenced chewing them. In a short while, by the
aid of tongue, teeth, and lips, they were formed into a little ball of
pulp, that rolled about in his mouth. Another step in the process<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
now became necessary. A small gourd, that hung around Guapo's
neck by a thong, was laid hold of. This was corked with a wooden
stopper, in which stopper a wire pin was fixed, long enough to reach
down to the bottom of the gourd.</p>

<p>After taking out the stopper, Guapo applied the lower part of the
pin to his lips, and then, plunging it once more into the gourd, drew
it out again. This time the pin came out, with a fine whitish powder
adhering to the part that had been wetted. Now what was this
powder? It was nothing else than lime that had been burned, and
pulverised. Perhaps it was the ashes of the moll&eacute; tree, of which we
have already spoken, and which, as we have said, possess a highly
alkaline property. The ashes of the musa, or plaintain, are sometimes
used; but, after all, it is most likely that it was the moll&eacute; ashes
which Guapo carried, for these are most highly esteemed by the
Indians of Southern Peru; and Guapo was a connoisseur in coca-eating.</p>

<p>Whichever of the three it was&mdash;lime, moll&eacute;, or musa&mdash;Guapo carried
the pin to his mouth, and, without touching his lips (it would have
burnt him if he had), he inserted it, so as to penetrate the ball of
chewed cocoa-leaves that rested upon the tip of his tongue. This
was stabbed repeatedly and adroitly by the pin, until all the powder
remained in the coca-ball; and then the pin was withdrawn, wiped,
and restored to its place, along with the stopper of the gourd.</p>

<p>Guapo now remained quietly &ldquo;ruminating&rdquo; for a period of about
forty minutes&mdash;for this is about the time required for chewing a mess
of cocoa-leaves. Indeed, so exactly is this time observed, that the
Indians, when travelling, measure distances by it; and one &ldquo;coceada&rdquo;
is about equal to the time occupied in walking a couple of English
miles.</p>

<p>The coceada of our old Indian being finished, he drew his llama-wool
poncho around him; and, leaning back against the rock, was
soon buried in a profound slumber.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE PUNA.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">B</span>y early dawn Guapo was awake, but he did not immediately awake
the others. It was still too dark to follow the mountain road. His
first care was to have his coca breakfast, and to this he applied himself
at once.</p>

<p>Day was fairly broke when he had ended the process of mastication,
and he bethought him of descending from the rock to arouse the
sleepers. He knew they still slept, as no voice had yet issued from
the grove of moll&eacute;s. The mule and horse were heard cropping the
grass, and the llamas were now feeding upon an open spot,&mdash;the first
they had eaten since their halt, as these creatures do not browse in
the night.</p>

<p>Guapo descended with fear in his heart. How it would have joyed
him to hear the voice of his master, or of any of them! But, no.
Not a sound proceeded from any one of the party. He stole nimbly
along the ledge, making his way through the moll&eacute; trees. At length
he reached the spot. All asleep?&mdash;yes, all! &ldquo;Are they dead?&rdquo;
thought Guapo, and his heart beat with anxiety. Indeed, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
seemed so. The fatigue of travel had cast a sickly paleness over the
faces of all, and one might easily have fancied they no longer lived.
But they breathed. &ldquo;Yes, they breathe!&rdquo; ejaculated the old Indian,
half aloud. &ldquo;They live!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guapo bent down, and seizing Don Pablo by the arm, shook him&mdash;at
first gently, uttering, at the same time, some words to awake him.
But neither the shaking nor the voice had any effect. Guapo shook
more violently, and shouted louder. Still Don Pablo slept. None of
the others moved&mdash;none of them heard him. It was strange, for the
Indian knew that Don Pablo himself, as well as the others, were
easily awaked on ordinary occasions. Guapo, becoming alarmed, now
raised his voice to its loudest pitch, at the same time dragging Don
Pablo's shoulder in a still more violent manner. This had the desired
effect. The sleeper awoke but so slowly, and evidently with such
exertion, that there was something mysterious in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he inquired, with half-opened eyes. &ldquo;Is it morning
already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sun is up. Rouse, my master! It is time we were on the
road,&rdquo; replied the Indian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel very drowsy&mdash;I am heavy&mdash;I can scarce keep my eyes
open. What can be the cause of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poison-trees, master,&rdquo; answered Guapo.</p>

<p>The answer seemed to impress Don Pablo. He made a violent
effort, and rose to his feet. When up he could scarcely stand. He
felt as though he had swallowed a powerful opiate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be so, good Guapo. Perhaps there is some truth in what
you have said. O, heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed he, suddenly recollecting
himself,&mdash;&ldquo;the others&mdash;my wife and children!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This thought had fully awakened Don Pablo; and Guapo and he
proceeded at once to arouse the others, which they effected after
much shouting and shaking. All were still heavy with sleep, and
felt as did Don Pablo himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely there is some narcotic power in the aroma of these trees,&rdquo;
muttered Don Pablo. &ldquo;Come, wife, let us be gone! We must remain
under its influence no longer, else what Guapo has said may prove
too true. Saddle up&mdash;we must eat our breakfasts farther on. To the
road!&mdash;to the road!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guapo soon had the horses ready, and all hurried from the spot,
and were once more climbing up the mountain-path. Even the
animals seemed to move slowly and lazily, as though they, too, had
been under the influence of some soporific. But the pure cold air of
the mountain soon produced its effect. All gradually recovered, and
after cooking some <i>charqui</i> and ocas in the ravine, and making their
breakfast upon these, they again felt light and fresh, and pursued
their journey with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>The road kept on up the ravine, and in some places the banks rose
almost perpendicularly from the bed of the dry torrent, presenting
on both sides vast walls of black porphyry&mdash;for this is the principal
rock composing the giant chain of the Andes. Above their heads
screamed small parrots of rich plumage of the species <i>Conurus
rupicola</i>, which make their nestling places, and dwell upon these
rocky cliffs. This is a singular fact, as all other parrots known are
dwellers among trees and are found in the forest at all times, except
when on their passage from place to place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p>But even the squirrel, which is an animal peculiarly delighting in
tree-life, has its representative in several species of ground-squirrels,
that never ascend a tree; and, among the monkeys, there exists the
troglodyte or cave-dwelling chimpanzee. No doubt squirrels or
monkeys of any kind, transported to an open or treeless country,
would soon habituate themselves to their new situation,&mdash;for Nature
affords many illustrations of this power of adaptation on the part of
her creatures.</p>

<p>It was near sunset when our travellers reached the highest point of
their route, nearly 14,000 feet above the level of the sea! Here they
emerged upon an open plain which stretched far before them. Above
this plain towered mountains of all shapes to a height of many
thousand feet from the level of the plain itself. Some of these
mountains carried their covering of eternal snow, which, as the
evening sun glanced upon it, exhibited the most beautiful tints of
rose, and purple, and gold. The plain looked bleak and barren, and
the cold which our travellers now felt added to the desolateness of
the scene. No trees were in sight. Dry yellow grass covered the
ground, and the rocks stood out naked and shaggy. They had
reached one of those elevated tables of the Andes known as the
<i>Puna</i>.</p>

<p>These singular tracts elevated above the level of cultivation are
almost uninhabited. Their only inhabitants are a few poor Indians,
who are employed by the rich proprietors of the lower valleys as
shepherds; for upon these cold uplands thrive sheep, and cattle, and
llamas, and flocks of the wool-bearing alpaco. Through this wild
region, however, you may travel for days without encountering even
a single one of the wretched and isolated inhabitants who watch over
these flocks and herds.</p>

<p>On reaching the Puna, our party had made their day's journey,
and would have halted. The llamas already showed signs of giving
out by stopping and uttering their strange booming note. But
Guapo knew these parts&mdash;for, though a descendant of the Incas,
he had originally come from the great forest beyond the eastern
slope of the Andes, where many of the Peruvian Indians had retired
after the cruel massacres of Pizarro. He now remembered, that not
far from where they were, was a shepherd's hut, and that the
shepherd himself was an old friend of his. That would be the place
to stop for the night; and, by Guapo's advice, Don Pablo resolved to
continue on to the hut.</p>

<p>Guapo fell upon his knees before the llamas, and, after caressing
and kissing them, and using a great variety of endearing expressions,
he at last coaxed these animals to proceed. No other means would
have availed, as beating would not make either llama budge an inch.
The leader, who was a fine large animal and a great favourite with
its master, at length stepped boldly out; and the other, encouraged
by the sound of the small bells that tinkled around the head of the
leader, followed after, and so the travellers moved on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, papa!&rdquo; cried Leon; &ldquo;you are tired yourself&mdash;mount this
horse&mdash;I can walk a bit:&rdquo; at the same instant the boy flung himself
from the back of the horse, and led him up to where his father
stood. Then handing the bridle to the latter, he struck off along
the plain, following Guapo and his llamas.</p>

<p>The road skirted round the rocks, where the mountain came down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
to meet the plain. The walk was not a long one, for the hut of
which Guapo spoke became visible at less than a quarter of a mile's
distance. An odd-looking hut it was&mdash;more like an ill-built stack of
bean-straw than a house. It had been built in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, a round ring of large stones had been laid, then a row of turf,
then another tier of stones, and so on, until the circular wall had
reached the height of about four or five feet, the diameter being not
more than eight or nine. On the top of the wall a number of poles
had been set, so as to meet above where they were tied together.
These poles were nothing else than the long flower-stalks of the
<i>maguey</i> or American aloe, as no other wood of sufficient length grew
in the vicinity. These poles served for rafters, and across them laths
had been laid, and made fast. Over all this was placed a thatch of the
long coarse Puna grass, which was tied in its place by grass ropes that
were stretched from side to side over the top. This was the hut of
Guapo's friend, and similar to all others that may be encountered in
the wild region of the Puna. A door was left in the side, not over
two feet high, so that it was necessary to crawl upon the hands and
knees before any one could reach the interior.</p>

<p>As our travellers approached, they saw that the entrance was
closed by an ox-hide which covered the whole of the opening.</p>

<p>Whether the shepherd was at home, was the next question; but as
they got near to the house, Guapo suggested that Don Pablo should
dismount and let Leon get upon horseback. This suggestion was
made on account of the Puna dogs&mdash;of which creatures Guapo had
a previous knowledge. These dogs, known by the name of Inca
dogs, are, perhaps, the fiercest animals of their species.</p>

<p>They are small, with pointed muzzles, tails curling upward, and
long shaggy hair. They are half-wild, snappish, and surly, as it is
possible for dogs to be. They attack strangers with fury, and it is
as much as their masters can do to rescue even a friend from their
attack. Even when wounded, and unable any longer to keep their
feet, they will crawl along the ground and bite the legs of those who
have wounded them. They are even more hostile to white people
than to Indians, and it is sometimes dangerous to approach an
Indian hut where three or four of these fierce creatures are kept,
as they will jump up against the side of a horse, and bite the legs
of the rider. Their masters often use the stick before they can get
obedience from them. In every Indian hut several of these animals
may be found, as they are extremely useful to the shepherds in
guarding their flocks and for hunting.</p>

<p>They are much employed throughout the Puna to hunt the &ldquo;yutu,&rdquo;
a species of partridge which inhabits the rushy grass. This bird
is traced by the dogs, seized before it can take to flight, and killed
by a single bite of its fierce pursuer. Considering the savage nature
of the Inca dogs, Guapo showed great caution in approaching the hut
of his friend. He first called loudly, but there was no reply. He
then stole forward with his long knife, or &ldquo;<i>machet&eacute;</i>,&rdquo; in his hand;
and having lifted the skin that covered the low doorway, peeped in.
The hut was empty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE WILD BULL OF THE PUNA.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">G</span>uapo was not much troubled at this. He knew he could take the
liberty of using his friend's roof for the night, even should the latter
not return to grant it. He crawled in. Of course his friend was
only temporarily absent&mdash;no doubt looking after his flocks of sheep
and alpacos; and as he was a bachelor, there was no wife at home,
but there were his furniture and utensils. Furniture! No&mdash;there
was none. There never is in the hut of a Puna shepherd. Utensils!
yes&mdash;there was an earthen &ldquo;olla,&rdquo; or pot to cook soup in, another
to boil or roast maize, a jar to hold water, a few split gourd-shells for
plates, two or three others for cups&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>This was the catalogue of utensils. Two stones set a little apart
formed the fireplace, in which the shepherd, when he makes a fire to
cook with, makes it out of dry dung. A couple of dirty sheep-skins
lay upon the ground. These were the bed. Nothing more was to
be seen. Yes, there was one thing more, and this gladdened the eyes
of Guapo. In a bag that hung against the wall, and on which he
soon laid his hands, he felt something&mdash;a collection of hard round
objects, about as big as large chestnuts. Guapo knew very well
what these were. He knew they were &ldquo;macas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What are <i>macas</i>? you will ask. Macas, then, are tuberous roots
that grow in the elevated regions of the Puna, where neither ocas,
ullucas, nor potatoes, will thrive. They are cultivated by the inhabitants,
and in many parts constitute almost the only food of
these wretched people. They have an agreeable and rather sweetish
flavour, and, when boiled in milk, taste somewhat like boiled chestnuts.
They can be preserved for more than a year by simply drying
them in the sun, and then exposing them to the cold air, when they
become hard and shrivelled. They thrive best in this high region,
for although they will grow in the lower valleys, they are there very
insipid and worthless. The Indians prepare them for food by
boiling them into a soup, or syrup, which is taken with parched
maize-corn.</p>

<p>Guapo knew that he had got his hands upon a bag of dried macas,
and although their owner was absent, he had already come to the
determination to appropriate them for himself and party. His joy
at the discovery had not subsided when another bag drew his attention,
and this was the signal for another delightful surprise. His
hand touched the new bag in a trice. There was a rattling sound
within. Peas? No&mdash;maize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; ejaculated Guapo; &ldquo;maize and macas! That with what
is left of the charqui&mdash;we shall not fast to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guapo now backed himself out of the hut, and joyfully announced
the discoveries he had made. The travellers dismounted. The horse
and mule were picketed on lassoes on the plain. The llamas were
left to go at will. They would not stray far from their owner.</p>

<p>It was piercing cold in this highland region. Do&ntilde;a Isidora and
the children entered the hut, while Don Pablo and Guapo remained
without for the purpose of collecting fuel. There was not a stick of
wood, as no trees of any sort grew near. Both strayed off upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
plain to gather the <i>taquia</i>, or ordure of the cattle, though no cattle
were in sight. Their tracks, however, were visible all around.</p>

<p>While engaged thus, the old Indian suddenly raised himself from
his stooping position with an exclamation that betokened alarm.
What had startled him? A loud bellowing was heard&mdash;it was the
bellowing of a bull. But what was there in that sound to alarm two
full-grown men? Ah! you know not the bulls of the Puna.</p>

<p>Coming around a promontory of rocks a large black bull was in
sight. He was approaching them in full run, his head thrown down,
his eyes glaring fiercely. At every spring he uttered a roar, which
was terrific to hear. A more horrid object it would be difficult to
conceive. You may suppose that an adventure with an enraged bull
is one of an ordinary character, and may occur any day, even in the
green meadow pastures of Old England. So it is, if the animal were
only an English bull. But it is a far different affair with the bulls of
the Puna.</p>

<p>Throughout all Spanish America animals of this kind are of a
fiercer nature than elsewhere. It is from them the bulls used in the
celebrated fights are obtained; and, perhaps, the race has been made
fiercer by the treatment they receive on such occasions&mdash;for many of
those that exhibit in the arena are afterwards used to breed from.
But, in general, the Spanish-American &ldquo;vacqueros,&rdquo; or cattle-herds,
treat the cattle under their charge with much cruelty, and this has
the effect of rendering them savage. Even in herds of cattle where
there are no bulls, there are cows so dangerous to approach, that the
vacqueros never attempt driving them unless when well mounted.</p>

<p>A Mexican or South American cattle-herd is, therefore, always a
mounted man. There is a difference, too, among the bulls in different
parts of these countries. On the Llanos of Venezuela they are not
so fierce as those of the Puna, and they are more and less so in
different parts of Mexico and the Pampas of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>The Puna bulls are, perhaps, the fiercest and most dangerous of all.
They are more than half wild. They scarcely ever see a human
being, and they will attack one upon sight. To a mounted man there
is little danger, unless by the stumbling or falling of his horse; but
many a poor Indian, crossing these high plains afoot, has fallen a
sacrifice to these vengeful brutes.</p>

<p>Both Don Pablo and Guapo knew all this, and therefore were
aware of their own danger. Neither had a weapon&mdash;not so much as
a stick. They had laid aside their knives and other arms, which had
been carried inside the hut. To reach the hut before the bull
reached <i>them</i> would be impossible; the brute was coming nearly
from it&mdash;for he had issued from some shelter in the rocks not far off.
They were full two hundred yards out upon the plain, and to run in
the direction of the rocks would have been to run counter to the
bull, and meet him face to face! Their danger was imminent. What
was to be done?</p>

<p>There was not much time left them for consideration. The furious
animal was within thirty paces distance, roaring loudly, shaking
his head and brandishing his long sharp horns. At this moment a
happy thought occurred almost simultaneously to Don Pablo and
the Indian. The evening, as we have already said, was piercing cold,
and both, in going out to collect the fuel, had worn their ponchos.</p>

<p>The trick of the matador with his red cloak suggested itself in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
moment of peril. Both had seen it performed&mdash;Don Pablo often&mdash;and
knew something of the &ldquo;way.&rdquo; In a moment both had stripped
the ponchos from their shoulders, and, placing themselves <i>&agrave; la matador</i>,
awaited the onset of the bull. It was agreed that as soon as the
bull was &ldquo;hooded&rdquo; by either, that both should run at all speed to
the rocks, where they could easily climb out of reach of the animal.</p>

<p>Don Pablo happened to be more in the way, and perhaps his more
showy poncho attracted the brute; but whether or not, he was the
first to receive the charge. With the adroitness of a practised
matador he flung his poncho on the horns of the animal, and then
both ran in the direction of the rocks. As they faced towards the
hut, however, to the horror of Don Pablo he saw the Do&ntilde;a Isidora,
with Leon and the little Leona, all outside, and even at some distance
from the entrance! Attracted by the bellowing of the bull and the
shouts of the men, they had rushed out of the hut.</p>

<p>Don Pablo, in wild accents, shouted to them to make for the door;
but, paralysed by terror, they were for some moments unable to
move. At length Do&ntilde;a Isidora, recovering herself, ran for the entrance,
pushing the children before her. But the low doorway was
difficult of access; they were slow in getting under it; and they
would have been too late, as the bull, after shaking off the poncho,
had turned and made directly for the hut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O God, preserve her!&rdquo; cried Don Pablo, as he saw the enraged
animal within a few paces of where his wife had knelt to enter the
doorway. &ldquo;She is lost! she is lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact, the bull was making directly towards her, and it seemed
as if nothing could then have interposed to save her.</p>

<p>At that moment the tramp of a horse in full gallop sounded on
their ears. Don Pablo looked up. A strange horseman was near
the spot&mdash;an Indian. Over his head a singular instrument was
revolving. There were three thongs fastened at one end, while at
the other end of each was a ball. These balls were whirling and
gyrating in the air. The next moment both thongs and balls were
seen to part from the hands of the rider, and wrap themselves around
the legs of the bull. The latter made an awkward spring forward,
and then fell upon the plain, where he lay kicking and helpless.
The horseman uttered a yell of triumph, sprang from his horse, and
running up to the prostrate animal, thrust the blade of his long
machet&eacute; into its throat. The red stream gushed forth, and in a few
seconds the black monster lay motionless upon the plain.</p>

<p>The new-comer quietly unwound the thongs&mdash;the <i>bolas</i>&mdash;from the
legs of the dead bull, and then addressed himself to our travellers.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE &ldquo;VAQUERO.&rdquo;</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">W</span>ho was this deliverer? No other than the vaquero&mdash;the friend
of Guapo,&mdash;who now welcomed Guapo and his companions, telling
them in the polite phraseology of all Spanish-Americans that his
<i>house(!)</i> was at their service. They were welcome to all it contained.</p>

<p>The macas, and maize, and a fresh steak from the wild bull, enabled
them to make a most excellent supper. In return for this hospitality,
Don Pablo made the vaquero a handsome present out of his purse;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
but what gratified him still more was a supply of coca which his
friend Guapo was enabled to bestow upon him, for his own stock
had been exhausted for some days. Guapo, on leaving Cuzco, had
spent his last <i>peseta</i> in buying this luxury, and therefore was well
provided for weeks to come.</p>

<p>After they had had supper, he and his friend seated themselves on
one side, and quietly chewed for a good half-hour, when at length
Guapo, who knew he could trust the vaquero&mdash;because the latter,
like himself, was one of the &ldquo;patriotas&rdquo;&mdash;communicated to him the
object of their journey through that desolate region. The vaquero
not only promised secrecy, but bound himself to put any party of
pursuers completely off the trail.</p>

<p>The vaquero, even in his remote mountain-home, had heard of Don
Pablo, knew that he was a good patriot and friend of the Indians,
and he would therefore have risked his life to serve such a man&mdash;for
no people have proved more devoted to the friends of their race than
these simple and faithful Indians of the Andes. How many instances
of noble self-sacrifice&mdash;even of life itself&mdash;occurred during the painful
history of their conquest by the cruel and sanguinary followers of
Pizarro!</p>

<p>The vaquero, therefore, did all in his power to make his guests
comfortable for the night. His dogs&mdash;there were four of them&mdash;were
not so hospitably inclined, for they did not seem to know friends from
enemies. They had come up shortly after their master himself
arrived, and had made a desperate attack upon everybody. The
vaquero, however, assisted by Guapo&mdash;who, being an Indian, was less
troubled with them&mdash;gave them a very rough handling with a large
whip which he carried; and then, securing the whole of them, tied
them together in a bunch, and left them at the back of the hut to
snap and growl at each other, which they did throughout the livelong
night. Supper over, all the travellers would have retired to
rest; but the vaquero, having announced that he was going out to
set snares for the chinchillas and viscachas, Leon could not rest, but
asked permission to accompany him. This was granted both by Don
Pablo and the vaquero himself.</p>

<p>The chinchilla, and its near relative the viscacha, are two little
animals of the rodent, or grass-eating kind, that inhabit the very
highest mountains of Peru and Chili. They are nearly of the same
size, and each about as big as a rabbit, which in habits they very
much resemble. They have long tails, however, which the rabbit has
not, though the latter beats them in the length of his ears. The
colour of the chinchilla is known to everybody, since its soft, velvety
fur is highly prized by ladies as an article of dress, and may be seen
in every London fur-shop.</p>

<p>The animal is of a beautiful marbled grey, white and black, with
pure white feet. The fur of the viscacha is not so pretty, being of a
brownish and white mixture. Its cheeks are black, with long, bristly
moustaches, like those of a cat; while its head resembles that of the
hare or rabbit. Both these innocent little creatures live upon the
high declivities of the Andes, in holes and crevices among the rocks,
where they remain concealed during the day, but steal out to feed
twice in the twenty-four hours,&mdash;that is, during the evening twilight
and in the early morning. The mode of capturing them is by snares
made of horse-hair, which are set in front of their caves&mdash;just as we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
snare rabbits in a warren, except that for the rabbits we make use of
light elastic wire, instead of the horse-hair.</p>

<p>Leon was delighted with the excursion, as the vaquero showed him
how to set the snares, and told him a great many curious stories of
Puna life and habits. Some of these stories were about the great
condor vulture&mdash;which the narrator, of course, described as a much
bigger bird than it really is, for the condor, after all, is not so much
bigger than the griffon vulture, or even the vulture of California.
But you, young reader, have already had a full account of the vultures
of America&mdash;the condor among the rest&mdash;therefore we shall not
repeat what was said by the vaquero about this interesting bird.</p>

<p>On the way to the place where the snares were to be set, they
passed a lagoon, or marshy lake, in which were many kinds of birds
peculiar to these high regions. Out on the open water they saw a
wild goose of a very beautiful species. It is called the &ldquo;Huachua&rdquo;
goose. Its plumage is of a snowy whiteness, all except the wings,
which are bright green and violet, while the beak, legs, and feet, are
scarlet. They also saw two species of ibis wading about in the marsh,
and a gigantic water-hen almost as big as a turkey. This last is of a
dark grey colour, with a red beak, at the base of which is a large
yellow knob of the shape of a bean. On this account it is called by
the Indians &ldquo;bean nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon the plain, near the border of the marsh, they noticed a
beautiful plover, having plumage marked very much like that of the
&ldquo;huachua&rdquo; goose, with green wings shining in the sun like polished
metal. Another curious bird also sat upon the plain, or flew around
their heads. This was a bird of prey of the species of jerfalcons
(<i>Polyborus</i>). The vaquero called it the &ldquo;Huarahua.&rdquo; He told Leon
it preyed only on carrion, and never killed its own food; that it was
very harmless and tame&mdash;which was evidently true, as, shortly after,
one of them seated upon a stone allowed the Indian to approach and
knock it over with a stick! Such a silly bird Leon had never seen.</p>

<p>The vaquero was quite a naturalist in his way&mdash;that is, he knew all
the animals of the Puna, and their habits, just as you will sometimes
find a gamekeeper in our own country, or often a shepherd or farm-servant.
He pointed out a rock-woodpecker, which he called a &ldquo;pito&rdquo;
(<i>Colaptes rupicola</i>), that was fluttering about and flying from rock to
rock. Like the cliff-parrots we have already mentioned, this rock-woodpecker
was a curious phenomenon, for, as their very name
implies, the woodpeckers are all tree-dwelling birds, yet here was one
of the genus living among rocks where not a tree was to be seen, and
scarcely a plant, except the thorny cactuses and magueys, with which
succulent vegetables the woodpecker has nothing to do. The &ldquo;pito&rdquo;
is a small, brown, speckled bird, with yellow belly, and there were
great numbers of them flying about.</p>

<p>But the bird which most fixed the attention of Leon was a little
bird about the size of a starling. Its plumage was rather pretty. It
was brown, with black stripes on the back, and white-breasted. But
it was not the plumage of the bird that interested Leon. It was
what his companion told him of a singular habit which it had&mdash;that
of repeating, at the end of every hour during the night, its melancholy
and monotonous note. The Indians call this bird the &ldquo;cock of the
Inca,&rdquo; and they moreover regard it with a sort of superstitious
reverence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>Having placed his snares, the vaquero set out to return with his
youthful companion. As they walked back along the mountain-foot,
a fox stole out from the rocks and skulked towards the marshy lake,
no doubt in search of prey. This fox was the <i>Canis Azar&aelig;</i>,
a most troublesome species, found all through South America. He is the
great pest of the Puna shepherds, as he is a fierce hunter, and kills
many of the young lambs and alpacos.</p>

<p>The vaquero was sorry he had not his dogs with him, as, from the
route the fox had taken, he would have been certain to have captured
him, and that would have been worth something, for the great sheep-owners
give their shepherds a sheep for every old fox that they can
kill, and for every young one a lamb. But the dogs, on this occasion,
had been left behind, lest they should have bitten Leon, and the
vaquero was compelled to let &ldquo;Reynard&rdquo; go his way. It was night
when they returned to the hut, and then, after Leon had related the
details of their excursion, all retired to rest.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">LLAMAS, ALPACOS, VICU&Ntilde;AS, AND GUANACOS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>ur travellers were stirring by early break of day. As they issued
from the hut, a singular and interesting scene presented itself to
their eyes. At one view&mdash;one <i>coup d'&#339;il</i>&mdash;they beheld the whole four
species of the celebrated camel-sheep of the Andes; for there are four
of them,&mdash;llama, guanaco, alpaco, and vicu&ntilde;a! This was a rare sight,
indeed. They were all browsing upon the open plain: first, the
llamas, near the hut; then a flock of tame alpacos, out upon the
plain; thirdly, a herd of seven guanacos farther off; and still more
distant, a larger herd of the shy vicu&ntilde;as. The guanacos and vicu&ntilde;as
were of uniform colours,&mdash;that is, in each flock the colour of the
individuals was the same; while among the llamas and alpacos there
were many varieties of colour. The latter two kinds were tame,&mdash;in
fact, they were under the charge of Guapo's friend the shepherd,
whereas the herds of vicu&ntilde;as and guanacos consisted of wild animals.</p>

<p>Perhaps no animal of South America has attracted so much attention
as the llama, as it was the only beast of burden the Indians had
trained to their use on the arrival of Europeans in that country.
So many strange stories were told by the earlier Spanish travellers
regarding this &ldquo;camel-sheep,&rdquo; that it was natural that great interest
should attach to it. These reported that the llama was used for
riding. Such, however, is not the case. It is only trained to carry
burdens; although an Indian boy may be sometimes seen on the
back of a llama for mischief, or when crossing a stream and the lad
does not wish to get his feet wet.</p>

<p>The llama is three feet high from hoof to shoulder, though his long
neck makes him look taller. His colour is generally brown, with
black and yellow shades, sometimes speckled or spotted; and there
are black and white llamas, but these are rare. His wool is long and
coarse, though the females, which are smaller, have a finer and better
wool. The latter are never used to carry burdens, but only kept for
breeding. They are fed in flocks upon the Puna heights, and it was
a flock of these that our travellers saw near the hut.</p>

<p>The males are trained to carry burdens at the age of four years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
A pack-saddle, called <i>yergua</i>, woven out of course wool, is fastened
on the back, and upon this the goods are placed. The burden never
exceeds 120 or 130 pounds. Should a heavier one be put on, the
llama, like the camel, quite understands that he is &ldquo;over-weighted,&rdquo;
and neither coaxing nor beating will induce him to move a step. He
will lie down, or, if much vexed, spit angrily at his driver, and this
spittle has a highly acrid property, and will cause blisters on the
skin where it touches. Sometimes a llama, over vexed by ill-treatment,
has been known, in despair, to dash his brains out against a
rock.</p>

<p>The llamas are used much in the mines of Peru, for carrying the
ore. They frequently serve better than either asses or mules, as they
can pass up and down declivities where neither ass nor mule can
travel. They are sometimes taken in long trains from the mountains
down to the coast region for salt and other goods; but on such
occasions many of them die, as they cannot bear the warm climate of
the lowlands. Their proper and native place is on the higher plains
of the Andes.</p>

<p>A string of llamas, when on a journey, is a very interesting spectacle.
One of the largest is usually the leader. The rest follow in
single file, at a slow, measured pace, their heads ornamented tastefully
with ribands, while small bells, hanging around their necks,
tinkle as they go. They throw their high heads from side to side,
gazing around them, and when frightened at anything, will &ldquo;break
ranks,&rdquo; and scamper out of their path, to be collected again with some
trouble.</p>

<p>When resting, they utter a low, humming noise, which has been
compared to the sound of an Eolian harp. They crouch down on
their breast&mdash;where there is a callosity&mdash;when about to receive their
burdens, and also sleep resting in the same attitude. A halt during
the day is necessary, in order that they may be fed, as these animals
will not eat by night. In consequence of this they make but short
journeys&mdash;ten to fifteen miles&mdash;although they will travel for a long
time, allowing them a day's rest out of every five or six. Like the
camels of the East, they can go days without water, and Buffon knew
one that went <i>eighteen months</i> without it! but Buffon is very poor
authority. When one of them becomes wearied, and does not wish to
proceed, it is exceedingly difficult to coax him onward.</p>

<p>These animals were at one time very valuable. On the discovery
of America a llama cost as much as eighteen or twenty dollars. But
the introduction of mules and other beasts of burden has considerably
cheapened them. At present they are sold for about four dollars in
the mining districts, but can be bought where they are bred and
reared for half that amount. In the days of the Incas their flesh was
much used as food. It is still eaten; but for this purpose the common
sheep is preferred, as the flesh of the llama is spongy and not very
well flavoured. The wool is used for many sorts of coarse manufacture.
So much for llamas. Now the &ldquo;guanaco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This animal (whose name is sometimes written &ldquo;huanaca,&rdquo; though
the pronunciation is the same with &ldquo;guanaco&rdquo; or &ldquo;guanaca&rdquo;) is
larger than the llama, and for a long time was considered merely as
the wild llama, or the llama <i>run wild</i>, in which you will perceive an
essential distinction. It is neither, but an animal of specific difference.
It exists in a wild state in the high mountains, though, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
great care and trouble, it can be domesticated and trained to carry
burdens as well as its congener the llama. In form it resembles the
latter, but, as is the case with most wild animals, the guanacos are
all alike in colour. The upper parts of the body are of a reddish
brown, while underneath it is a dirty white. The lips are white, and
the face a dark grey. The wool is shorter than that of the llama, and
of the same length all over the body. The guanaco lives in herds of
five or seven individuals, and these are very shy, fleeing to the most
inaccessible cliffs when any one approaches them. Like the chamois
of Switzerland and the &ldquo;bighorn&rdquo; of the Rocky Mountains, they can
glide along steep ledges when neither men nor dogs can find footing.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;alpaco,&rdquo; or &ldquo;paco,&rdquo; as it is sometimes called, is one of the
most useful of the Peruvian sheep, and is more like the common sheep
than the others. This arises from its bulkier shape, caused by its
thick fleece of long wool. The latter is soft, fine, and often five inches
in length; and, as is well known, has become an important article in
the manufacture of cloth. Its colour is usually either white or black,
though there are some of the alpacos speckled or spotted. Ponchos
are woven out of alpaco-wool by the Indians of the Andes.</p>

<p>The alpaco is a domesticated animal, like the llama, but it is not
used for carrying burdens. It is kept in large flocks, and regularly
shorn as sheep are. If one of the alpacos gets separated from the
flock, it will lie down and suffer itself to be beaten to death, rather
than go the way its driver wishes. You have, no doubt, sometimes
seen a common sheep exhibit similar obstinacy.</p>

<p>Of all the Peruvian sheep the vicu&ntilde;a is certainly the prettiest and
most graceful. It has more the form of the deer or antelope than of
the sheep, and its colour is so striking that it has obtained among
the Peruvians the name of the animal itself, <i>color de vicu&ntilde;a</i> (vicu&ntilde;a
colour). It is of a reddish yellow, not unlike that of our domestic
red cat, although the breast and under parts of the body are white.
The flesh of the vicu&ntilde;a is excellent eating, and its wool is of more
value than even that of the alpaco. Where a pound of the former
sells for one dollar&mdash;which is the usual price&mdash;the pound of alpaco
will fetch only a quarter of that sum. Hats and the finest fabrics
can be woven from the fleece of the vicu&ntilde;a, and the Incas used to
clothe themselves in rich stuffs manufactured from it. In the present
day the &ldquo;ricos,&rdquo; or rich proprietors of Peru, pride themselves in possessing
ponchos of vicu&ntilde;a wool.</p>

<p>The vicu&ntilde;a inhabits the high plains of the Andes, though, unlike
the guanaco, it rarely ventures up the rocky cliffs, as its hoofs are
only calculated for the soft turf of the plains. It roams about in
larger herds than the other&mdash;eighteen or twenty in the herd&mdash;and
these are usually females under the protection and guidance of one
polygamous old male. While feeding, the latter keeps watch over
the flock, usually posting himself at some distance, so that he may
have a better opportunity of seeing and hearing any danger that
may approach. When any is perceived, a shrill whistle from the
leader and a quick stroke of his hoof on the turf warn the flock; and
all draw closely together, each stretching out its head in the direction
of the danger. They then take to flight, at first slowly, but
afterwards with the swiftness of the roe; while the male, true to his
trust, hangs in the rear, and halts at intervals, as if to cover the
retreat of the herd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>The llama, guanaco, alpaco, and vicu&ntilde;a, although different species,
will breed with each other; and it is certain that some of their
hybrids will again produce young. There exist, therefore, many
intermediate varieties, or &ldquo;mules,&rdquo; throughout the countries of the
Andes, some of which have been mistaken for separate species.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class="cap">A VICU&Ntilde;A HUNT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he vicu&ntilde;a being of such value, both inside and out, both in flesh and
wool, is hunted by the mountain Indians with great assiduity. It is
an animal most difficult to approach, and there is rarely any cover
on these naked plains by which to approach it.</p>

<p>The chief mode of capturing it is by the &ldquo;chacu.&rdquo; This cannot be
effected by a single hunter. A great number is required. Usually
the whole population of one of the villages of the &ldquo;Sierras&rdquo; lower
down turns out for this sport, or rather business, for it is an annual
source of profit. Even the women go along, to cook and perform
other offices, as the hunt of the <i>chacu</i> sometimes lasts a week or
more.</p>

<p>A hunting party will number from fifty to one hundred persons.
They climb up to the <i>altos</i>, or high and secluded plains, where the
vicu&ntilde;a dwells in greatest numbers. They carry with them immense
coils of ropes, and a large quantity of coloured rags, together with
bundles of stakes three or four feet in length. When a proper part
of the plain has been chosen, they drive in the stakes four or five
yards apart and running in the circumference of a circle, sometimes
nearly a mile in diameter.</p>

<p>A rope is then stretched from stake to stake, at the height of
between two and three feet from the ground, and over this rope are
hung the coloured rags provided for the occasion, and which keep
fluttering in the wind. A sort of scare-crow fence is thus constructed
in the form of a ring, except that on one side a space of about two
hundred yards is left open to serve as an entrance for the game.
The Indians then, most of them on horseback, make a grand d&eacute;tour,
extending for miles over the country; and having got behind the
herds of vicu&ntilde;as, drive them within the circle, and close up the
entrance by completing the ring.</p>

<p>The hunters then go inside, and using the <i>bolas</i>, or even seizing the
animals by their hind-legs, soon capture the whole. Strange to say,
these silly creatures make no attempt to break through the sham
fence, nor even to leap over it. Not so with the guanacos, when so
enclosed. The latter spring against the fence at once, and if, by
chance, a party of guanacos be driven in along with the vicu&ntilde;as, they
not only break open the rope enclosure and free themselves, but also
the whole herd of their cousins, the vicu&ntilde;as. It is, therefore, not
considered any gain to get a flock of guanacos into the trap.</p>

<p>The hunt usually lasts several days, but during that time the
enclosure of ropes is flitted from place to place, until no more vicu&ntilde;as
can be found. Then the ropes, stakes, &amp;c., are collected, and the
produce of the hunt distributed among the hunters. But the
Church levies its tax upon the &ldquo;chacu,&rdquo; and the skins&mdash;worth a
dollar each&mdash;have to be given up to the priest of the village. A good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
round sum this amounts to, as frequently four or five hundred vicu&ntilde;as
are taken at a single <i>chacu</i>.</p>

<p>A good hunter is sometimes able to &ldquo;approach&rdquo; the vicu&ntilde;a.
Guapo's friend was esteemed one of the best in all the Puna. The
sight of the herd out on the plain, with their graceful forms, and
beautiful reddish-orange bodies, was too much for him, and he
resolved to try his skill upon them. He said he had a plan of his
own, which he intended to practise on this occasion.</p>

<p>Don Pablo and his party&mdash;even Do&ntilde;a Isidora and the little Leona&mdash;were
all outside the hut, although the morning air was raw and chill.
But the domicile of the worthy vaquero was not empty, for all that.
It was peopled by a very large colony of very small animals, and a
night in their society had proved enough for the travellers. The
chill air of the Puna was even more endurable than such company.</p>

<p>The vaquero crawled back into the hut, and in a few minutes
returned, but so metamorphosed, that had the party not seen him
come out of the doorway they would have mistaken him for a llama!
He was completely disguised in the skin of one of these animals.
His face only was partly visible, and his eyes looked out of the breast.
The head and neck of the skin, stuffed with some light substance,
stood up and forward, after the manner of the living animal, and
although the legs were a little clumsy, yet it would have required a
more intelligent creature than the vicu&ntilde;a to have observed this
defect.</p>

<p>All hands, even the saturnine Guapo, laughed loudly at the counterfeit,
and the vaquero himself was heard to chuckle through the long
wool upon the breast. He did not lose time, however, but instantly
prepared to set off. He needed no other preparation than to get
hold of his <i>bolas</i>,&mdash;that was his favourite weapon. Before going
farther, I shall tell you what sort of weapon it is.</p>

<p>The bolas consist of three balls&mdash;hence the name&mdash;of lead or stone,
two of them heavier than the third. Each ball is fastened to the
end of a stout thong made of twisted sinews of the vicu&ntilde;a itself, and
the other ends of the three thongs are joined together. In using
them the hunter holds the lightest ball in his hand, and twirls the
other two in circles around his head, until they have attained the
proper velocity, when he takes aim and launches them forth.</p>

<p>Through the air fly the thongs and balls, and all whirling round in
circles, until they strike some object; and if that object be the legs
of an animal, the thongs become immediately warped around them,
until the animal is regularly hoppled, and in attempting to escape
comes at once to the ground. Of course great practice is required
before such an instrument can be used skilfully; and to the novice
there is some danger of one of the balls hitting him a crack on the
head, and knocking over himself instead of the game. But there was
no danger of Guapo's friend the vaquero committing this blunder.
He had been swinging the bolas around his head for more than forty
years!</p>

<p>Without more ado, then, he seized the weapon, and, having gathered
it with his <i>fore-feet</i> into a portable shape, he proceeded in the direction
of the vicu&ntilde;as.</p>

<p>The travellers remained by the hut, watching him with interest,
but his movements were particularly interesting to Leon, who, like
all boys, was naturally fond of such enterprises.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>The herd of vicu&ntilde;as was not more than three quarters of a mile off.
For the first half of this distance the vaquero shambled along right
speedily, but as he drew nearer to the animals he proceeded slower
and with more caution.</p>

<p>The pretty creatures were busily browsing, and had no fear. They
knew they were well guarded by their faithful sentinel, in whom
they had every confidence,&mdash;the lord and leader of the herd. Even
from the hut, this one could be seen standing some distance apart
from the rest. He was easily recognised by his greater bulk and
prouder bearing.</p>

<p>The false llama has passed near the guanacos, and they have taken
no heed of him. This is a good omen, for the guanacos are quite as
sharp and shy as their smaller cousins, and since he has succeeded in
deceiving them, he will likely do the same for the vicu&ntilde;as. Already
he approaches them. He does not make for the herd, but directly
for the leader. Surely he is near enough; from the hut he seems
close up to the creature. See! the vicu&ntilde;a tosses his head and strikes
the ground with his hoof. Listen! it is his shrill whistle. The
scattered herd suddenly start and flock together; but, look! the
<i>llama</i> stands erect on his hind-legs; the bolas whirl around his head&mdash;they
are launched out. Ha! the vicu&ntilde;a is down!</p>

<p>Where is the female drove? Have they scampered off and forsaken
their lord? No! faithful as a loving wife, they run up to share his
danger. With shrill cries they gather around him, moving to and
fro. The llama is in their midst. See! he is dealing blows with some
weapon&mdash;it is a knife! his victims fall around him&mdash;one at every
blow; one by one they are falling. At last, at last, they are all
down,&mdash;yes, the whole herd are stretched, dead or dying, upon the
plain!</p>

<p>The struggle is over; no sound is heard, save the hoof-stroke of the
guanacos, llamas, and alpacos, that cover the plain in their wild flight.</p>

<p>Leon could no longer restrain his curiosity; but ran off to the
scene of the slaughter. There he counted no less than nineteen
vicu&ntilde;as lying dead, each one stabbed in the ribs! The Indian assured
him that it was not the first <i>battue</i> of the kind he had made. A
whole herd of vicu&ntilde;as is often taken in this way. When the male is
wounded or killed, the females will not leave him; but, as if out of
gratitude for the protection he has during life afforded them, they
share his fate without making an effort to escape!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="cap">CAPTURING A CONDOR.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he vaquero with his horse soon dragged the vicu&ntilde;as to the hut.
Guapo gave him a help with the mule, and in a few minutes they
were all brought up. One of them was immediately skinned, and
part of it prepared for breakfast, and our travellers ate heartily of
it, as the cold Puna air had given an edge to their appetites.</p>

<p>The new-killed animals, along with the red skin of the bull, which
had been spread out on the ground at some distance from the hut,
had already attracted the condors; and four or five of these great
birds were now seen hovering in the air, evidently with the intention
of alighting at the first opportunity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>An idea seemed to enter the head of the vaquero, while his guests
were still at breakfast, and he asked Leon if he would like to see a
condor caught. Of course Leon replied in the affirmative. What boy
wouldn't like to see a condor caught?</p>

<p>The vaquero said he would gratify him with the sight, and without
staying to finish his breakfast&mdash;indeed he had had his &ldquo;coceada,&rdquo; and
didn't care for any,&mdash;he started to his feet, and began to make preparations
for the capture.</p>

<p>How he was to catch one of these great birds, Leon had not the
slightest idea. Perhaps with the &ldquo;bolas,&rdquo; thought he. That would
have done well enough if he could only get near them; but the
condors were sufficiently shy not to let any man within reach either
with bolas or guns. It is only when they have been feasting on
carrion, and have gorged themselves to repletion, that they can be thus
approached, and then they may be even knocked over with sticks.</p>

<p>At other times the condor is a shy and wary bird. No wonder
either that he is so, for, unlike most other vultures, he is hunted and
killed at all times. The vultures of most countries are respected by
the people, because they perform a valuable service in clearing away
carrion; and in many parts these birds are protected by statute.
There are laws in the Southern United States, and in several of the
Spanish-American Republics, which impose fines and penalties for
killing the black vultures. In some Oriental countries, too, similar
laws exist. But no statute protects the condor. On the contrary,
he is a proscribed bird, and there is a bounty on his head, because he
does great damage to the proprietors of sheep, and llamas, and alpacos,
killing and devouring the young of these animals. His large quills,
moreover, are much prized in the South American cities, and the
killing of a condor is worth something. All this will account for the
shyness of this great bird, while other vultures are usually so tame
that you may approach within a few paces of them.</p>

<p>As yet the half-dozen condors hovering about kept well off from
the hut; and Leon could not understand how any one of them was
to be caught.</p>

<p>The vaquero, however, had a good many &ldquo;dodges,&rdquo; and after the
<i>ruse</i> he had just practised upon the vicu&ntilde;as, Leon suspected he would
employ some similar artifice with the condors. Leon was right. It
was by a stratagem the bird was to be taken.</p>

<p>The vaquero laid hold of a long rope, and lifting the bull's hide
upon his shoulders, asked Guapo to follow him with the two horses.
When he had got out some four or five hundred yards from the hut,
he simply spread himself flat upon the ground, and drew the skin
over him, the fleshy side turned upward. There was a hollow in the
ground about as big as his body&mdash;in fact, a trench he had himself
made for a former occasion&mdash;and when lying in this on his back, his
breast was about on a level with the surrounding turf.</p>

<p>His object in asking Guapo to accompany him with the horses was
simply a <i>ruse</i> to deceive the condors, who from their high elevation
were all the while looking down upon the plain. But the vaquero
covered himself so adroitly with his red blanket, that even their keen
eyes could scarcely have noticed him; and as Guapo afterwards left
the ground with the led horses, the vultures supposed that nothing
remained but the skin, which from its sanguinary colour to them
appeared to be flesh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>The birds had now nothing to fear from the propinquity of the hut.
There the party were all seated quietly eating their breakfast, and
apparently taking no notice of them. In a few minutes' time, therefore,
they descended lower, and lower,&mdash;and then one of the very
largest dropped upon the ground within a few feet of the hide. After
surveying it for a moment, he appeared to see nothing suspicious
about it, and hopped a little closer. Another at this moment came
to the ground&mdash;which gave courage to the first&mdash;and this at length
stalked boldly on the hide, and began to tear at it with his great
beak.</p>

<p>A movement was now perceived on the part of the vaquero&mdash;the hide
&ldquo;lumped&rdquo; up, and at the same time the wings of the condor were
seen to play and flap about as if he wanted to rise into the air, but
could not. He was evidently held by the legs!</p>

<p>The other bird had flown off at the first alarm, and the whole band
were soon soaring far upward into the blue heavens.</p>

<p>Leon now expected to see the vaquero uncover himself. Not so,
however, as yet. That wily hunter had no such intention, and
although he was now in a sitting posture, grasping the legs of the
condor, yet his head and shoulders were still enveloped in the bull's
hide. He knew better than to show his naked face to the giant
vulture, that at a single &ldquo;peck&rdquo; of his powerful beak would have
deprived him of an eye, or otherwise injured him severely. The
vaquero was aware of all this, and therefore did not leave his hiding-place
until he had firmly knotted one end of the long cord around the
shank of the bird&mdash;then slipping out at one side, he ran off to some
distance before stopping. The condor, apparently relieved of his
disagreeable company, made a sudden effort and rose into the air,
carrying the hide after him. Leon shouted out, for he thought the
vulture had escaped; but the vaquero knew better, as he held the
other end of the cord in his hand; and the bird, partly from the
weight of the skin, and partly from a slight tug given by the hunter,
soon came heavily to the ground again. The vaquero was now joined
by Guapo; and, after some sharp man&#339;uvring, they succeeded between
them in passing the string through the nostrils of the condor,
by which means it was quietly conducted to the hut, and staked on
the ground in the rear&mdash;to be disposed of whenever its captor should
think fit.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE PERILS OF A PERUVIAN ROAD.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span>t was as yet only an hour or so after daybreak&mdash;for the vicu&ntilde;a hunt
had occupied but a very short time and the capture of the condor a
still shorter. Don Pablo was anxious to be gone, as he knew he was
not beyond the reach of pursuit. A pair of the vicu&ntilde;as were hastily
prepared, and packed upon a llama for use upon their journey. Thus
furnished, the party resumed their route.</p>

<p>The vaquero did not accompany them. He had an office to perform
of far more importance to their welfare and safety. As soon as they
were gone he let loose his four snarling curs, and taking them out to
where the pile of dead vicu&ntilde;as lay upon the plain, he left them there
with instructions to guard the carcasses from foxes, condors, or whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
else might wish to make a meal off them. Then mounting, he
rode off to the place where the road leading from Cuzco ascended
upon the table-land, and having tied his horse to a bush, he climbed
upon a projecting rock and sat down. From this point he commanded
a view of the winding road to the distance of miles below him.</p>

<p>No traveller&mdash;much less a party of soldiers&mdash;could approach without
his seeing them, even many hours before they could get up to where
he sat; and it was for that reason he had stationed himself there.
Had Don Pablo been pursued, the faithful Indian would have galloped
after and given him warning, long before his pursuers could have reached
the plain.</p>

<p>He sat until sunset&mdash;contenting himself with a few leaves of coca.
No pursuer appeared in sight. He then mounted his horse, and rode
back to his solitary hut.</p>

<p>Let us follow our travellers.</p>

<p>They crossed the table-plain during the day, and rested that night
under the shelter of some overhanging rocks on the other side. They
supped upon part of the vicu&ntilde;as, and felt more cheerful, as they
widened the distance between themselves and danger. But in the
morning they did not remain longer by their camp than was necessary
to get breakfast. Half-an-hour after sunrise saw them once more on
their route.</p>

<p>Their road led through a pass in the mountains. At first it
ascended, and then began to go downward. They had crossed the
last ridge of the Andes, and were now descending the eastern slopes.
Another day's journey, or two at most, would bring them to the
borders of that wild forest, which stretches from the foot-hills of the
Andes to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean&mdash;that forest with scarcely
a civilised settlement throughout all its wide extent&mdash;where no roads
exist&mdash;whose only paths are rivers&mdash;whose dark jungles are in places
so impenetrable that the Indian cannot enter them, and even the
fierce jaguar, embarrassed by the thick underwood, has to take to
the tree-tops in pursuit of his prey. Another day's journey or so
would bring them to the borders of the &ldquo;Monta&ntilde;a&rdquo;&mdash;for such is the
name which, by a strange misapplication of terms, has been given to
this primeval wood. Yes, the Monta&ntilde;a was before them, and
although yet distant, it could now and then be seen as the road
wound among the rocks, stretching far towards the sky like a green
and misty ocean.</p>

<p>In that almost boundless region there dwelt none but the
aborigines of the soil&mdash;the wild Indians&mdash;and these only in sparse
and distant bands. Even the Spaniards in their day of glory had
failed to conquer it; and the Portuguese from the other side were
not more successful.</p>

<p>The Spanish colonists, on the Peruvian or western border of this
immense forest, had never been able to penetrate it as colonists or
settlers. Expeditions from time to time had passed along its rivers
in search of the fabled gold country of <i>Manoa</i>, whose king each
morning gave himself a coating of gold dust, and was hence called
El Dorado (the gilded); but all these expeditions ended in mortification
and defeat. The settlements never extended beyond the <i>sierras</i>,
or foot-hill of the Andes, which stretch only a few days' journey (in
some places but a score of leagues) from the populous cities on the
mountain-heights.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>Even at this present time, if you travel thirty leagues eastward of
the large town of Cuzco, in the direction taken by Don Pablo, you
will pass the boundaries of civilisation, and enter a country unexplored
and altogether unknown to the people of Cuzco themselves!
About the &ldquo;Monta&ntilde;a&rdquo; very little is known in the settlements of the
Andes. Fierce tribes of Indians, the jaguar, the vampire bat, swarms
of mosquitoes, and the hot atmosphere, have kept the settler, as well
as the curious traveller, out of these wooded plains.</p>

<p>Don Pablo had already passed the outskirts of civilisation. Any
settlement he might find beyond would be the hut of some half-wild
Indian. There was no fear of his encountering a white face upon
the unfrequented path he had chosen, though had he gone by some
other route he might have found white settlements extending farther
to the eastward. As it was, the wilderness lay before him, and he
would soon enter it.</p>

<p><i>And what was he to do in the wilderness?</i> He knew not. He had
never reflected on that. He only knew that behind him was a
relentless foe thirsting for his life. To go back was to march to
certain death. He had no thoughts of returning. That would have
been madness. His property was already confiscated&mdash;his death
decreed by the vengeful Viceroy, whose soldiers had orders to capture
or slay, whenever they should find him. His only hope, then, was
to escape beyond the borders of civilisation&mdash;to hide himself in the
great Monta&ntilde;a. Beyond this he had formed no plan. He had
scarcely thought about the future. Forward, then, for the Monta&ntilde;a!</p>

<p>The road which our travellers followed was nothing more than
a narrow path or &ldquo;trail&rdquo; formed by cattle, or by some party of
Indians occasionally passing up from the lower valleys to the
mountain-heights. It lay along the edge of a torrent that leaped
and foamed over its rocky bed. The torrent was no doubt on its
way to join the greatest of rivers, the mighty Amazon&mdash;the head-waters
of which spring from all parts of the Andes, draining the
slopes of these mountains through more than twenty degrees of
latitude.</p>

<p>Towards evening the little party were beginning to enter among
the mountain spurs, or foot-hills. Here the travelling grew exceedingly
difficult, the path sometimes running up a steep acclivity
and then descending into deep ravines&mdash;so deep and dark that the
sun's rays seemed hardly to enter them. The road was what Spanish-Americans
term, &ldquo;<i>Cuesta arriba, cuesta abajo</i>&rdquo; (up hill, down hill).</p>

<p>In no part of the world are such roads to be met with as among
the Andes Mountains, both in South America and in their Mexican
continuation through the northern division of the continent. This
arises from the peculiar geological structure of these mountains.
Vast clefts traverse them, yawning far into the earth. In South
America these are called <i>quebradas</i>. You may stand on the edge of
one of them and look sheer down a precipice two thousand feet!
You may fancy a whole mountain scooped out and carried away,
and yet you may have to reach the bottom of this yawning gulf by
a road which seems cut out of the face of the cliff, or rather has
been formed by a freak of Nature&mdash;for in these countries the hand of
man has done but little for the roads.</p>

<p>Sometimes the path traverses a ledge so narrow that scarce room
is found for the feet of your trusty mule. Sometimes a hanging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
bridge has to be crossed, spanning a horrid chasm, at the bottom of
which roars a foaming torrent&mdash;the bridge itself, composed of ropes
and brambles, all the while swinging like a hammock under the
tread of the affrighted traveller!</p>

<p>He who journeys through the tame scenery of European countries
can form but little idea of the wild and dangerous highways of the
Andes. Even the passes of the Alps or Carpathians are safe in
comparison. On the Peruvian road the lives of men and animals are
often sacrificed. Mules slide from the narrow ledges, or break
through the frail &ldquo;soga&rdquo; bridges, carrying their riders along with
them, whirling through empty air to be plunged into foaming
waters or dashed on sharp rocks below.</p>

<p>These are accidents of continual occurrence; and yet, on account of
the apathy of the Spano-Indian races that inhabit these countries,
little is done for either roads or bridges. Every one is left to take
care of himself, and get over them as he best may. It is only now
and then that positive necessity prompts to a great effort, and then
a road is repaired or a broken bridge patched with new ropes.</p>

<p>But the road that was travelled by Don Pablo had seen no repairs&mdash;there
were no bridges. It was, in fact, a mere pathway where the
traveller scrambled over rocks, or plunged into the stream, and
forded or swam across it as he best could. Sometimes it lay along
the water's edge, keeping in the bottom of the ravine; at other
places no space was left by the water, and then the path ascended
and ran along some ledge perhaps for miles, at the end of which it
would again descend to the bed of the stream.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class="cap">ENCOUNTER UPON A CLIFF.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>hat night they encamped in the bottom of the ravine close to the
water's edge. They found just enough of level ground to enable
them to stretch themselves, but they were contented with that.
There was nothing for the animals to eat except the succulent, but
thorny, leaves of the <i>Cactus opuntia</i>, or the more fibrous blades of
the wild agave. This evening there were no quinoa seeds to be had,
for none of these trees grew near. Even the botanist, Don Pablo,
could find no vegetable substance that was eatable, and they would
have to sup upon the vicu&ntilde;a meat, without bread, potatoes, or other
vegetables. Their stock of ocas, ullucas, and macas, was quite out.
They had cooked the last of the macas for that morning's meal.</p>

<p>Guapo here came to their relief. Guapo's experience went beyond
the theoretical knowledge of the botanist. Guapo knew a vegetable
which was good to eat&mdash;in fact, a most delicious vegetable when
cooked with meat. This was no other than the fleshy heart of the
wild maguey (<i>agave</i>), with part of the adhering roots. Among naked
rocks, in the most barren parts of the desert wilderness, the wild
agave may be found growing in luxuriance. Its thick, succulent
blades, when split open, exude a cool liquid, that often gives considerable
relief to the thirsty traveller; while the heart, or egg-shaped
nucleus from which spring the sheathing leaves&mdash;and even
parts of the leaves themselves&mdash;when cooked with any sort of meat,
become an excellent and nourishing food.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>The Indians make this use of the aloe on the high plains of Northern
Mexico, among the roving bands of the Apach&eacute;, Navajo, and Comanch&eacute;.
These people cook them along with horse's flesh, for there
the wild horse is the principal food of whole tribes. Their mode of
cooking, both the flesh and the aloe, is by baking them together in
little ovens of stones sunk in the ground, and then heated by fire
until they are nearly red hot. The ashes are then cleared out, the
meat and vegetables placed in the ovens, and then buried until both
are sufficiently done. In fact, there is one tribe of the Apach&eacute;s who
have obtained the name of &ldquo;Mezcaleros,&rdquo; from the fact of their
eating the wild aloe, which in those countries goes under the name
of &ldquo;mezcal&rdquo; plant.</p>

<p>In many parts of the Andes, where the soil is barren, the wild
maguey is almost the only vegetation to be seen, and in such places
the Indians use it as food. It seems to be a gift of Nature to the
desert, so that even there man may find something on which to subsist.</p>

<p>Guapo with his knife had soon cleared off several large pieces of
the maguey, and these, fried along with the vicu&ntilde;a meat, enabled the
party to make a supper sufficiently palatable. A cup of pure water
from the cold mountain stream, sweeter than all the wine in the
world, washed it down; and they went to rest with hearts full of
contentment and gratitude.</p>

<p>They rose at an early hour, and, breakfasting as they had supped,
once more took the road.</p>

<p>After travelling a mile or two, the path gradually ascended along
one of those narrow ledges that shelve out from the cliff, of which we
have already spoken. They soon found themselves hundreds of feet
above the bed of the torrent, yet still hundreds of feet above them
rose the wall of dark porphyry, seamed, and scarred, and frowning.
The ledge or path was of unequal breadth&mdash;here and there forming
little tables or platforms. At other places, however, it was so narrow
that those who were mounted could look over the brink of the
precipice into the frothing water below&mdash;so narrow that no two
animals could have passed each other. These terrible passes were
sometimes more than an hundred yards in length, and not straight,
but winding around buttresses of the rock, so that one end was not
visible from the other.</p>

<p>On frequented roads, where such places occur, it is usual for
travellers, entering upon them, to shout, so that any one who chances
to be coming from the opposite side, may have warning and halt.
Sometimes this warning is neglected, and two trains of mules or
llamas meet upon the ledge! Then there is a terrible scene&mdash;the
drivers quarrel&mdash;one party has to submit&mdash;their animals have to be
unloaded and dragged back by the heels to some wider part of the
path, so that each party can get past in its turn!</p>

<p>Near the highest part of the road, our travellers had entered upon
one of these narrow ledges, and were proceeding along it with
caution. The trusty mule, that carried Do&ntilde;a Isidora and Leona,
was in front, the horse followed, and then the llamas. It is safer to
ride than walk on such occasions, especially upon mules, for these
animals are more sure-footed than the traveller himself. The horse
that carried Leon, however, was as safe as any mule. He was one of
the small Spanish-American breed, almost as sure-footed as a chamois.</p>

<p>The torrent rushed and thundered beneath. It was fearful to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
listen and look downward; the heads of all were giddy, and their
hearts full of fear. Guapo, alone accustomed to such dangers, was
of steady nerve. He and Don Pablo afoot were in the rear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/illus-196.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="GUAPO&#39;S ENCOUNTER WITH THE BULLS." title="GUAPO&#39;S ENCOUNTER WITH THE BULLS." />
<span class="caption">GUAPO&#39;S ENCOUNTER WITH THE BULLS.</span></div>

<p>They had neared the highest point of the road, where a jutting
rock hid all beyond from their view. They were already within a
few paces of this rock, when the mule&mdash;which, as we have stated,
was in the front&mdash;suddenly stopped, showing such symptoms of
terror that Do&ntilde;a Isidora and the little Leona both shrieked!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>Of course all the rest came to a halt behind the terrified and
trembling mule. Don Pablo, from behind, shouted out, inquiring
the cause of the alarm; but before any answer could be given the
cause became apparent to all. Around the rock suddenly appeared
the head and horns of a fierce bull, and the next moment his whole
body had come into view, while another pair of horns and another
head were seen close behind him!</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the feelings of our travellers at
that moment. The bull came on with a determined and sullen look,
until he stood nearly head to head with the mule. The smoke of his
wide steaming nostrils was mingled with the breath of the terrified
mule, and he held his head downward, and evidently with the intention
of rushing forward upon the latter. Neither could have gone
back, and of course the fierce bull would drive the mule into the
abyss. The other bull stood close behind, ready to continue the work
if the first one failed, and, perhaps, there were many others behind!</p>

<p>The mule was sensible of her danger, and, planting her hoofs
firmly on the hard rock, she clung closely to the precipice. But this
would not have served her, had not a hand interposed in her behalf.
Amidst the terrified cries of the children, the voice of Guapo was
heard calling to Don Pablo,&mdash;&ldquo;Your pistols, master! give me your
pistols!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something glided quickly among the legs of the animals. It was
the lithe body of the Indian. In a second's time he appeared in
front of the mule. The bull was just lowering his head to charge
forward&mdash;his horns were set&mdash;the foam fell from his lips&mdash;and his
eyes glanced fire out of their dark orbs. Before he could make the
rush, there came the loud report of a pistol&mdash;a cloud of sulphury
smoke&mdash;a short struggle on the cliff&mdash;and then a dead plunge in the
torrent below!</p>

<p>The smoke partially cleared away; then came another crack&mdash;another
cloud&mdash;another short struggle&mdash;and another distant plash in
the water!</p>

<p>The smoke cleared away a second time. The two bulls were no
longer to be seen!</p>

<p>Guapo, in front of the mule, now ran forward upon the ledge, and
looked around the buttress of rock. Then, turning suddenly, he
waved his hand, and shouted back,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more, master; you may come on&mdash;the road is clear!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE LONE CROSS IN THE FOREST.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span>fter two more days of fatiguing travel, the road parted from the
bank of the river, and ran along the ridge of a high mountain spur
in a direction at right angles to that of the Andes themselves. This
spur continued for several miles, and then ended abruptly. At the
point where it ended, the path, which for the whole of the day had
been scarcely traceable, also came to an end. They were now of
course in a forest-covered country&mdash;in the <i>Ceja de la Monta&ntilde;a</i>&mdash;that
is, the forest that covers the foot-hills of the mountains. The forest
of the plains, which were yet lower down, is known as the &ldquo;Monta&ntilde;a&rdquo;
proper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>During that day they had found the road in several places choked
up with underwood, and Guapo had to clear it with his <i>machet&eacute;</i>&mdash;a
sort of half-sword, half-knife, used throughout all Spanish America,
partly to cut brushwood and partly as a weapon of defence. Where
the ridge ended, however, what had once been a road was now
entirely overgrown&mdash;vines and llianas of large size crossed the path.
Evidently no one had passed for years. A road existed no longer;
the luxuriant vegetation had effaced it.</p>

<p>This is no unusual thing on the borders of the Monta&ntilde;a. Many a
settlement had existed there in former times, and had been abandoned.
No doubt the road they had been following once led to some such
settlement that had long since fallen into ruin.</p>

<p>It is a melancholy fact that the Spanish-Americans&mdash;including the
Mexican nation&mdash;have been retrograding for the last hundred years.
Settlements which they have made, and even large cities built by
them, are now deserted and in ruins; and extensive tracts of country,
once occupied by them, have become uninhabited, and have gone
back to a state of nature. Whole provinces, conquered and peopled
by the followers of Cortez and Pizarro, have within the last fifty
years been retaken from them <i>by the Indians</i>: and it would be very
easy to prove, that had the descendants of the Spanish conquerors,
been left to themselves, another half century would have seen them
driven from that very continent which their forefathers so easily
conquered and so cruelly kept. This re-conquest on the part of the
Indian races was going on in a wholesale way in the northern provinces
of Mexico. But it is now interrupted by the approach of
another and stronger race from the East&mdash;the Anglo-American.</p>

<p>To return to our travellers. Don Pablo was not surprised that the
road had run out. He had been expecting this for miles back.
What was to be done? Of course they must halt for that night at
least. Indeed it was already near camping-time. The sun was low
in the sky, and the animals were all much jaded. The llamas could
not have gone much farther. They looked as if they should never go
farther. The heat of the climate&mdash;it had been getting warmer every
hour&mdash;was too much for them. These animals, whose native home is
among the high cool mountain valleys, as already observed, cannot
live in the low tropical plains. Even as they descended the Sierras
they had shown symptoms of suffering from the heat during all that
day. Their strength was now fairly exhausted.</p>

<p>The party halted. A little open space was chosen for the camp.
The animals were relieved of their burdens and tied to the trees, lest
they might stray off and be lost in the thick woods. A fire was
kindled, and part of the vicu&ntilde;a meat cooked for supper.</p>

<p>It was not yet night when they had finished eating, and all were
seated on the ground. The countenance of the father was clouded
with a melancholy expression. Do&ntilde;a Isidora sat by his side and tried
to cheer him, endeavouring to force a smile into her large black eyes.
The little Leona, with her head resting on her mother's lap, overcome
with the heat and fatigue, had fallen asleep. Leon, seeing the
dejected look of his father, was silent and thoughtful. Guapo was
busy with his llamas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, dear husband!&rdquo; said the lady, trying to assume a cheerful
tone, &ldquo;do not be so sad. We are now safe. Surely they will never
pursue us here.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They may not,&rdquo; mechanically replied Don Pablo; &ldquo;but what then?
We have escaped death, for what purpose? Either to live like
savages in these wild woods&mdash;perhaps to be killed by savages&mdash;perhaps
to die of hunger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not say so, Don Pablo. I have never heard that the Indians
of these parts were cruel. They will not injure poor harmless people
such as we are. And as for starving, are not these luxuriant woods
filled with roots and fruits that will sustain life a long while? You,
too, know so well what they are! Dear husband, do not despond;
God will not forsake us. He has enabled us to escape from our
enemies, from fearful dangers on our journey. Fear not! He will
not leave us to perish now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cheering words of his beautiful wife had their effect upon Don
Pablo. He embraced and kissed her in a transport of love and
gratitude. He felt inspired with new hope. The vigour of mind and
body, that for days had deserted him, now suddenly returned; and
he sprang to his feet evidently with some newly-formed resolution.</p>

<p>The country both before and behind them was shut out from their
view by the thick foliage and underwood. A tall tree grew by the
spot, with branches down to the level of a man's head. Don Pablo
approached this tree, and seizing the branches drew himself up, and
then climbed on towards its top. When he had reached a sufficient
height, to overlook the surrounding woods, he stopped; and, resting
himself upon one of the branches, looked abroad towards the east.
All the rest stood watching him from below.</p>

<p>He had been gazing but a few seconds when his face brightened up,
and a smile of satisfaction was seen to play upon his countenance.
He evidently saw something that pleased him. Isidora, impatient,
called out to him from below; but Don Pablo waved his hand to her,
as if admonishing her to be silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have patience, love,&rdquo; he cried down. &ldquo;I shall descend presently
and tell you all. I have good news, but be patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It required a good share of patience, for Don Pablo after this
remained a full half-hour upon the tree. He was not all the time
looking abroad, however. Part of it he sat upon his perch&mdash;his head
leaning forward, and his eyes not appearing to be particularly engaged
with anything. He was busy with his thoughts, and evidently
meditating on some great project. Perhaps the going down of the
sun admonished him, as much as the desire of satisfying his wife's
curiosity, but just as the bright orb was sinking among the far tree-tops
he descended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Don Pablo,&rdquo; said the fair Isidora, pretending to frown and
look angry, &ldquo;you have tried our patience, have you not? Come,
then, no more mystery, but tell us all. What have you seen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, wife; you shall know all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both sat down upon the trunk of a dead tree that Guapo had felled,
and was cutting up for firewood: not that it was at all cold, but they
had now arrived in the country of the terrible <i>jaguar</i>, and it would
be necessary to keep up a blazing fire throughout the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your words were true, love,&rdquo; began Don Pablo. &ldquo;God has not
forsaken us. I have seen three things that have inspired me with
fresh life and hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, I looked out upon the Monta&ntilde;a, which I expected to see
stretching away to the horizon, like a green ocean. I saw this in fact;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
but, to my surprise, I saw more. I beheld a broad river winding like
an immense serpent through the distant forest. It ran in a direction
north-east, as far as the eye could reach. Even upon the horizon I
could distinguish spots of its bright water glancing like silver under
the rays of the setting sun. My heart leaped with joy, for I recognised
a river whose existence has been doubted. It can be no other,
thought I, than the <i>Madre de Dios</i>. I have often heard that there
existed such a river in these parts, that runs on to the Amazon. A
missionary is said to have visited it, but with the destruction of the
missions the record has been lost. I have no doubt the river I have
seen is the <i>Madre de Dios</i> of that missionary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thought of being so near the banks of this river suggested
other thoughts. At once a design entered into my mind. &ldquo;We can
build a raft,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;launch it upon this noble river, and float
down to the Amazon, and thence to the mouth of the great stream
itself. There is a Portuguese settlement there&mdash;the town of Grand
Para. There we shall be safe from our foes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such were my first thoughts on beholding the new river. I reflected
further. &ldquo;Our fortune is gone,&rdquo; I reflected; &ldquo;we have nothing
in the wide world&mdash;what should we do at Para, even if we arrived
there in safety? How could we attempt such a journey without
provisions. It would be impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My hopes fell as quickly as they had sprung up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I noticed your countenance change as you sat upon the tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, you might easily have done so: the prospect of reaching
Para, penniless, and becoming a beggar in the streets&mdash;the nearer
prospect of starving in the wilderness of the Amazon&mdash;were before
my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My eyes for awhile were bent mechanically upon the green ocean
of tree-tops. All at once an object arrested them. It was a patch of
bright rose-coloured foliage, easily distinguishable amid the green
leaves that surrounded it. It was not down in the Monta&ntilde;a&mdash;for that
is a thousand feet below us. It was upon the side of the Sierra. My
eyes glanced quickly around. I beheld other patches of similar
foliage, some of them nearly an acre in breadth. My heart again
leaped with joy. I knew well what these red spots of the forest
were. They were clumps of <i>cinchona</i> trees&mdash;those trees that yield the
celebrated febrifuge&mdash;the Peruvian bark!</p>

<p>New ideas passed rapidly through my mind. &ldquo;Our fortune is
gone,&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;Here is a fortune in these valuable trees. Here
is a mine that only requires to be worked. I shall turn <i>cascarillero</i>&mdash;I
shall be a <i>bark-hunter</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first I thought that we might gather the bark, and send Guapo
to sell it in the towns of the Sierra. Then the idea came into my
mind that it might be possible to collect an immense quantity, store
it up, build a great raft, float it down the rivers, and dispose of it in
Para. I knew that in this way it would more than quadruple its
price&mdash;for the traders of the Sierra purchase it from the poor cascarilleros,
and have enormous profits upon it from the larger merchants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how to live while making this store? Yes, how to live even
on the morrow? Could we support ourselves by hunting, or find
sustenance from fruits and roots, as you have suggested? This was
the most important question of all, for our present necessities far
outweighed our future prospects.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The very thought of our necessity caused me once more to glance
over the forest, and I continued to scan it on all sides. My eye was
again arrested, and fixed upon a point where I saw there existed a
different vegetation from any that could be seen elsewhere. There is
a small valley about five hundred feet below us. It is a sort of table
valley, and the stream along which we have been travelling runs
through it, afterwards dashing over a fall to join the river below. In
this valley I saw huge broad leaves of a brilliant yellowish green. I
knew them at once to be the leaves of the great <i>musace&aelig;</i>, either
plantains or bananas. I thought, too, I could distinguish the form of
the <i>yucca</i> plant. These are the certain signs of some settlement, or
where one has existed. I fancy the latter is the correct idea, as I
could distinguish neither house nor smoke. It may be some deserted
Indian 'chacra,' or it may be the grounds of an old mission. In
either case, we shall be likely to find those useful plants from which
we may obtain food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa! mamma!&rdquo; cried Leon, running up and interrupting
the conversation. &ldquo;See what is here among the trees! I declare it
is a great cross!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don Pablo and Isidora walked towards the spot. There, sure
enough, was a large wooden cross planted in the ground, and leaning
to one side. The wood was much decayed, but the inscription that
had been deeply cut in the transverse beam was still legible. It was
simply the Spanish phrase:&mdash;</p>

<center>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Brazos de Dios</span>&rdquo; (The arm of God).<br />
</center>

<p>Isidora took Don Pablo by the hand, and looking steadfastly in his
face, pointed to the inscription.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> true,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;God protects us!&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE DESERTED MISSION.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>hat night all went to rest with hope in their hearts, though still not
without some anxiety.</p>

<p>If you reflect upon the situation in which they were placed, you
will not wonder that they were anxious about the future. Their first
care had been to fly into the wilderness, without thinking upon the
necessities they might encounter there&mdash;without reflecting that they
had made no provision of food to sustain them. It is true that in the
great Monta&ntilde;a there are many plants and trees whose roots and fruits
can be eaten; but a traveller may go for days without finding one of
these. Indeed, to pass through this great forest, in most places, is
impossible, so completely are the creeping parasites matted and laced
together. It is necessary to keep along the rivers in a canoe or raft,
else you cannot get from place to place.</p>

<p>You cannot even walk along the banks of many of these rivers, as
the underwood hangs into the very water! For the same reason
game is hard to be procured, and neither Don Pablo nor Guapo were
provided with proper weapons to hunt with. Don Pablo's pistols
were all the fire-arms they had, and Guapo had no other weapon than
his machet&eacute;. With their present means, then, there was very little
chance of their killing any game, even should they have fallen in with
it. But they saw none as yet, except some birds, such as parrots,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
macaws, and toucans, that fluttered among the leaves. No wonder,
then, they were anxious about what they should find to eat, or
whether they should find anything at all.</p>

<p>Don Pablo considered the cross a good omen, or rather a good <i>sign</i>.
Some missionary must have planted it in years gone by. No doubt a
missionary station must have been near; and it was highly probable
that what he had seen in the little valley below would turn out to be
the very place where it had stood.</p>

<p>As soon as it became day, therefore, Don Pablo again ascended the
tree to take the bearings of the valley, so that they should proceed
towards it. Guapo also climbed up, so that both might make sure of
the route they ought to take&mdash;for in the tangled forests of South
America it is no easy matter to reach any object, which you may
have only seen at a distance from the top of a tree. Without a compass,
the traveller soon loses his direction; and, after hours of vain
exertion and devious wandering, often finds himself at the very place
from which he had started.</p>

<p>After carefully noting the direction of the valley, Don Pablo and
Guapo came down from the tree; and while the former, assisted by
Leon, packed and saddled the animals, Guapo was busy with his
machet&eacute; in clearing away the brushwood that obstructed the path.
This did not turn out such a task after all. It was only at the brow
of the ridge, where the undergrowth had choked up the way. A little
farther down it was quite passable, and the party, animals and all,
were soon winding down the Sierra towards the valley. Half-an-hour's
travelling brought them to their destination; and then a shout of
joy, coming simultaneously from all of them, announced their arrival
upon the spot.</p>

<p>What was it that caused them to utter this shout of joy? Before
them towered the great <i>musace&aelig;</i>&mdash;plantains and bananas. There
were both: their broad yellow-green and wax-like leaves sheathing
their succulent stems, and bending gracefully over to a length of
twenty feet. But beautiful as were the leaves of these giant plants,
more attractive still to the eyes of our travellers were the huge
clusters of fruit-pods that hung from beneath them. Each of these
would have weighed nearly an hundred-weight! There was food for
hundreds. These plants grew by the water's edge, in a damp soil&mdash;their
natural habitat. Their leaves drooped over the stream. Another
plant, equally interesting, was seen farther back, in a dry place.
There were many of these ten or fifteen feet high, and as thick as a
man's wrist. This was the <i>yucca</i> plant. All of them knew it. They
knew that its roots produced the far-famed cassava. Cassava is bread.
Hurrah! the staff of life was secure!</p>

<p>But, more than this, there were fruits in abundance; there were
mangoes and guavas, oranges and the celebrated cherimoya&mdash;the
favourite of Peru. There were shaddocks and sweet limes; and see!
yonder is a clump of sugar-canes, with their thin silken leaves and
yellow tassels waving in the wind. Oh, look here! Here is a coffee-shrub,
with its ripe, aromatic berries; and here is the cacao-tree.
Coffee and chocolate&mdash;there was a choice of beverages! Ha! what
have we here&mdash;this plant like an orange tree? It is a species of holly.
As I live, it is the <i>yerba mat&eacute;</i>, the &ldquo;Paraguay tea.&rdquo; What shall we
light upon next?</p>

<p>And so the delighted travellers went on, over the ground, through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
the thick-tangled weeds and convolvuli, making new discoveries at
every step. Even Guapo's favourite, the coca-shrub, was found growing
among the rest, and the eyes of the old Indian sparkled at the
sight of it.</p>

<p>Don Pablo's first conjecture had been right. They had arrived at
the ruin of some old missionary station, long since deserted. Some
zealous monk had planted all these plants and trees; had for years,
no doubt, tended them with care; had dreamt of establishing around
this lonely spot a great hierarchy, and making the &ldquo;wilderness blossom
as the rose.&rdquo; An evil day had come&mdash;perhaps during the revolt of
Juan Santos, or maybe in the later revolution of Tupac Amaru. The
hand of the savage had been turned against the priest, who had fallen
a victim, and his roof&mdash;the mission-house&mdash;had been given to the
flames. Not a vestige of building was to be seen&mdash;neither stick nor
stone&mdash;and had it not been for the curious variety of vegetation
collected on the spot, this once cultivated and flourishing garden
might have been taken for part of the primeval forest.</p>

<p>It must have been a long time since the place was inhabited, for
great trees and parasites had grown up in the midst of the cultivated
plants.</p>

<p>After the first transports of delight had to some extent subsided,
a consultation was held as to future proceedings. They were not long
in coming to a conclusion. It was resolved that a house should be
built in the middle of this wild garden, which should be, for a time at
least, their home.</p>

<p>The poor llamas had made their last journey. They were to be
killed. Guapo, although reluctant to part with his old favourites,
knew that they could not live in the warm climate of the valley, and
therefore consented. Their flesh, it is true, is none of the best, but it
would taste the better that no other was to be had; and their wool
and skins would be found useful. The llamas were killed.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE GUACO AND THE CORAL SNAKE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span>t was Guapo himself that killed the llamas, and, having skinned
them, he cut the flesh into thin strips, and hung it upon the branches
to dry in the sun. This, of course, was necessary, as they had no
salt to cure it with; but meat well dried under a hot sun will keep
good for a long time. It is curious, that in all Spanish-American
countries they preserve most of their meat in this way, whereas in
North America, among the people of our own race, &ldquo;jerked beef&rdquo;
(for that is the name we give it) is very rare.</p>

<p>Now, in Spanish-America there are vast depositories of salt&mdash;both
in mines and on plains, with salt lakes&mdash;called <i>salinas</i>; yet, for want
of a proper commercial activity existing among these people, in
many places the valuable article, salt, is both scarce and dear. In
Mexico dried or &ldquo;jerked&rdquo; beef is called &ldquo;tasajo.&rdquo; In Peru, as we
have stated, it is &ldquo;charqui;&rdquo; but mutton cured in this way is
distinguished by the name &ldquo;chalona.&rdquo; Now as the llamas are a
species of sheep, it was &ldquo;chalona&rdquo; that Guapo was making out of
their mutton.</p>

<p>The others were not idle; Don Pablo, assisted by Leon, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
clearing a place on which they intended to build the house, while
the Do&ntilde;a Isidora, with her soft slender fingers (for the first time in
her life, perhaps), was acting as laundress, and the little Leona
assisted her as much as she was able. Where did they get their soap,
for they had not brought so much as a single cake along with them?</p>

<p>But Don Pablo was too good a botanist not to know the nature of
the trees that grew around, and the uses to which they could be
applied. Near by grew a curious tree, which is known among the
Indians as the <i>parapara</i>. It was the soap-berry of botanists and
Don Pablo knew that the bark of the berries, when rubbed, produces
a lather that will wash linen equal to the best &ldquo;Castile.&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a
Isidora was not long in making a trial of it, and found this to be
true. The little round stones of the berries, when cleared of the
pulp, are very pretty, and are much used by the missionaries in
making rosaries. Leon found, dropping one of them on a stone,
that it was as elastic as a ball of India rubber, for it rebounded
several times the height of a man's head!</p>

<p>In the evening they all rested from their various occupations, and
seated themselves upon the new-cleared ground, upon the trunk
of a tree that had been felled. They were one and all quite cheerful.
They felt no more apprehension of pursuit. It would have been
a very revengeful enemy, indeed, who would have followed them so
far into the wilderness. They had no fear of that. Do&ntilde;a Isidora
had just cooked a kettle of coffee&mdash;they had both pots and kettles,
for these were some of the utensils with which Guapo, even in the
hurry of flight, had taken the precaution to load his llamas.</p>

<p>This coffee turned out to be of the finest quality. It was of a
peculiar species, which has long been cultivated by the missionaries
of Peru, and which yields a very high price. It used to be sent
by the viceroys as a valued present to the kings of Spain. To
sweeten the coffee some joints of sugar-cane had been crushed, and
boiled in a rough manner; and for bread they had roasted plantains.
During the repast they were all quite merry, and pleasant jokes
were passed for the first time in many days.</p>

<p>While thus engaged a singular sound fell upon their ears. It was
like a voice repeating the word &ldquo;Guaco!&rdquo; They all listened. &ldquo;Guaco&mdash;Guaco!&rdquo;
again came the voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hola!&rdquo; cried Leon, &ldquo;Guapo&mdash;Guapo! there's some one calling
you, Guapo. There again!&mdash;no&mdash;it's 'Guaco'&mdash;listen! Guaco&mdash;Guaco'
What is it, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's the snake-bird,&rdquo; quietly answered Guapo, who, it must be
remembered, was a native of the Monta&ntilde;a, and knew a great deal
both about the birds and beasts of these regions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The snake-bird?&rdquo; exclaimed Leon, evidently interested in the
name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, young master!&rdquo; replied Guapo; &ldquo;look! yonder it goes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eyes of all were instantly turned in the direction pointed out
by Guapo. There sure enough was a bird, not much larger than
a common pigeon, but which had all the appearance of a sparrow-hawk.
It was &ldquo;swallow-tailed,&rdquo; however, and this, with its peculiar
form and the manner of its flight, showed that it was one of the
kite-hawks. When first noticed, it was perched upon the top of
a high tree, but it soon flew to another not so high, uttering as it
went, the &ldquo;Guaco&mdash;Guaco!&rdquo; It then pitched itself to a still lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
branch, and was evidently after something which none of the party
could see. That something, however, soon became apparent. The
ground had been cleared in a broad track down to the water's edge,
and near the middle of the open space an object was observed in
motion, making towards the weeds. That object was a snake.</p>

<p>It was not a large one&mdash;not more than three feet in length&mdash;and
its beautiful body, variegated with bands of black, red, and bright
yellow, glistened as it moved. Its predominating colour was a fleshy
red, or coral, from whence it has its name, for both Don Pablo and
Guapo, as soon as they saw it, pronounced it the &ldquo;coral snake.&rdquo;
Beautiful as it appeared, all knew that it was one of the most
poisonous of serpents&mdash;one of the most dreaded of South American
reptiles.</p>

<p>The first thought of Guapo and Leon was to spring up, seize upon
some weapon, and kill the creature. Don Pablo, however, restrained
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;be patient; we shall have a scene.
Look at the hawk,&mdash;see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Don Pablo spoke, the guaco, which had hopped down to the
lowest branches of a neighbouring tree, swooped suddenly at the
snake, evidently aiming to clutch it around the neck. The latter,
however, had been too quick, and coiling itself, like a flash of
lightning darted its head out towards the bird in a threatening
manner. Its eyes sparkled with rage, and their fiery glitter could be
seen even at many yards distance.</p>

<p>The bird diverged from its course, and after passing the snake,
turned and swooped again from the opposite direction. But the
reptile had shifted its body so as to meet the attack, and its threatening
head once more was reared high above its coiled body. The
guaco was foiled a second time.</p>

<p>This second failure seemed to enrage the bird, as it turned at
shorter intervals, and apparently losing all fear, fluttered over the
reptile, striking both with beak and claws. The latter still kept in
its coil, but its head moved hastily from side to side, so as always to
&ldquo;show front&rdquo; to its active antagonist.</p>

<p>After this play had continued for some time, the snake was seen to
draw in its head farther than usual, and the hawk, evidently somewhat
off his guard, deeming this a fair opportunity, pounced forward
to seize it. But he was met half way. The head of the serpent shot
forward like a rapier, and reached his breast. The hawk felt that
he was wounded; and uttering a wild scream, he flew suddenly
away.</p>

<p>All eyes watched him as he flew off, expecting that he would fall&mdash;for
the bite of the coral snake will kill even a man in a few minutes,
and a bird or small animal in much less time. It is not correct to
say that all of them expected to see him fall. Guapo, from experience,
knew better, and even Don Pablo, as a naturalist, had
heard a strange account of this singular bird, and was curious to
witness the result. The hawk, therefore, was narrowly watched.</p>

<p>It flew directly for a tree, up against the trunk of which, and
clinging to its branches, grew a parasite or creeping plant. The
latter was of the thickness of a willow rod, with long slender leaves,
of a dark green colour. The bird did not alight upon the top of the
tree, but on a branch where it could reach the leaves of the creeper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
which it began immediately to pluck and devour. In a short while
it had eaten as many as a dozen of these long leaves, when it again
took to wing, and flew back in the direction of the snake.</p>

<p>All had, for the moment, forgotten the snake, in their eagerness to
watch the movements of the bird. To their astonishment the reptile
was still in the same place, and coiled up as when last seen. This
was easily explained, however, as snakes who defend themselves in
that attitude usually remain coiled, until they are certain that their
enemy has gone away and will not return to the attack.</p>

<p>The contest was now renewed with redoubled fury. The bird
fought with fresh courage, knowing that he had taken precautions
against a fatal result, while the snake defended itself with the energy
of despair. This time the battle was a short one. The guaco, using
its wings, succeeded in striking its antagonist upon the upraised
head, and quickly following up the blow, planted his talons so as to
encircle the throat of his victim. The effect of his gripe was
instantly apparent. The reptile unfolded itself, and the slender
coral body was seen writhing and twisting along the ground. But
it did not remain long upon the ground, for in a few moments the
guaco rose into the air, and carried the struggling victim into the
woods to devour it at his leisure.</p>

<p>Now Guapo was exceedingly pleased at what had occurred. Why?
It was not because such a scene was at all new to him. No; he had
often witnessed such, and was no longer curious upon that head. It
was something more than mere curiosity that moved Guapo. When
the affair was over, he rose from his seat, and stalking off to the place
where the bird had been seen to eat the leaves, he gathered a quantity
of them, and then returned to the fire. Don Pablo recognised
them as the leaves of a plant of the genus <i>Mikania</i>, and known
popularly as the &ldquo;vejuco de guaco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guapo knew nothing of the scientific designation of the plant, but
he had long ago been taught the valuable properties of its leaves as
an antidote against the bite of the most poisonous snakes. He had
known them to cure the bite of the cascabel (<i>rattle-snake</i>), and even
of the small spotted viper, the most poisonous of all the American
snakes.</p>

<p>What, then, did Guapo with the leaves of the vejuco? First, he
chopped them up as fine as he could, and then, tying them tightly in
a piece of cotton cloth, he expressed from them a quantity of juice&mdash;enough
for his purpose. That done, with the point of a knife he
made small incisions between his toes, and also upon his breast and
fingers. Into each of these incisions, even while the blood was
flowing from them, he dropped the juice of the Mikania, and rubbed
it in with fresh leaves of the plant itself; and then, with some tufts
of the soft floss of the silk-cotton tree he covered the incisions, so as
to stop the bleeding. He wound up this strange performance, by
chewing some of the leaves, and swallowing about a spoonful of the
juice. This made the &ldquo;inoculation&rdquo; complete, and Guapo, as he himself
declared, was now invulnerable to the bite of the most venomous
serpent!</p>

<p>He offered to &ldquo;inoculate&rdquo; the others in the same way. They at
first refused&mdash;Don Pablo among the rest&mdash;but after a day or two,
when each of the party had met with several narrow escapes from
vipers, coral snakes, and the much-dreaded &ldquo;jararaca,&rdquo; Don Pablo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
thought it prudent that all should submit to the operation, and
accordingly Guapo &ldquo;doctored&rdquo; the party without more ado.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE PALM-WOODS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span>t happened, that upon the opposite side of the stream there was a
broad track covered with palm-trees, while not one was to be seen
on that side where they intended building their house. As these
are the most convenient trees for constructing a house to suit the hot
climate of the Monta&ntilde;a, it appeared necessary that they should use
them. But how were they to get at them? The stream flowed
between them and the camp; and although not a large river, yet at
that place it was very wide and deep, for in the flat table valley it
expanded to the dimensions of a little lake.</p>

<p>Below, where it issued out of the valley, it ran for some distance
in a deep cleft between rocky banks almost or quite perpendicular,
and above the valley it came dashing through an impassable ravine.
If they could only get over to cut the palms, they knew they could
roll them to the bank, and float them across the stretch of still water.
But how to get over required some consideration. Guapo could
swim like a water-dog, but Don Pablo could not; and Leon, having
been brought up as a town boy, had had but little practice, and
consequently was but a poor swimmer. What, then, was to be done,
as Guapo could not well manage the palms without help?</p>

<p>After examining the stream, both above and below, no crossing
place could be found, but just at the point where it ran out of the
valley, the space between the high banks was very narrow. A good
long plank would have reached across it&mdash;had they only had one&mdash;but
that they had not. Now, upon the opposite bank there grew a
tall tree. It was one of the beautiful silk-cotton trees already
mentioned. It stood upon the very edge of the chasm. Both Don
Pablo and Guapo saw at a glance that this tree could be felled, and
made to fall across the stream, so as to form the very bridge they
wanted.</p>

<p>Not much time was lost about it. Guapo, tying his axe upon his
shoulders, ran up the near side, until he was opposite the still running
water; and then plunging in, swam across in a few seconds. He
soon after appeared on the opposite bank, at the root of the bombax,
which he attacked in such a manner that one who did not know
what he was about might have fancied he was angry at it. In a few
minutes a great notch appeared in the side of the tree, and Guapo
continuing his sturdy blows, made the yellow chips fly out in showers.
Of course the notch was cut on the side next the stream, so that the
tree would fall in that direction. The beaver understands that
much, and Guapo had considerably more intelligence than any
beaver.</p>

<p>In about half-an-hour the bombax began to creak and lean a little.
Then Don Pablo threw over a lasso, which had been brought along.
Guapo noosed one end over a high limb, and tying a stone to the
other, pitched it back to Don Pablo, who hauled it taut. Then a few
cuts of the axe broke the skin of the tree on the other side, Don
Pablo pulled by the rope, and with a loud tear and a crash, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
vast deal of crackling among the branches, the great bombax settled
into a horizontal position across the chasm. The bridge was built.</p>

<p>After all, it was no slight adventure to cross it. The rounded
trunk was anything but sure footing, and even had it been a flat
plank, the depth of the chasm&mdash;nearly an hundred feet clear&mdash;and
the white roaring torrent below, were enough to shake the stoutest
nerves. All, however, got over in safety, and proceeded up to the
palm-woods. I say all&mdash;but I mean only the male population of the
new settlement. Do&ntilde;a Isidora and the little Leona remained by the
camp, both of them busy scraping <i>yucca</i> roots, to be manufactured
into cassava, and then into bread.</p>

<p>On arriving among the palm-trees, Don Pablo was struck with a
singular fact. He observed (indeed, he had already noticed as much
from the opposite side of the river) that instead of one species of
palm, there were not less than a dozen kinds growing in this wood.
This was a very unusual circumstance, as although two or three
species are often found together, such a varied collection as were
there could only have been made by human hands. Here, again, was
recognised the work of the missionary monk, who had no doubt
planted most of the species, having received them very likely from
many distant stations of his fellow-labourers in other parts of the
Amazon valley.</p>

<p>Whether Franciscan, Jesuit, or Dominican (for all three have had
their missions in this part of the world), the holy father who resided
here, thought Don Pablo, must have been an ardent horticulturist.
Whether or not he converted many Indians to his faith, he seemed
to have exerted himself to provide for their temporal necessities, for
there was hardly a useful plant or tree suitable to the climate that
was not to be found growing near the spot. Such were the reflections
of Don Pablo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a variety of beautiful palms!&rdquo; said he, looking around
upon these by far the fairest forms of the vegetable creation.</p>

<p>Now, my boy reader, I have not the slightest doubt but that you,
too, think the palms the fairest forms of the vegetable creation. I
have not the shadow of a doubt that your heart beats joyfully at the
very word &ldquo;palm;&rdquo; that you love to gaze at one of the stately trees,
and that you would give all your pocket-money for an afternoon's
ramble through a real palm-wood. Would you not? Yes. I am
sure of it. Now I could tell you a great deal about palms if I <i>would</i>;
and I would, too, if my space and time allowed me, but neither will,
alas! Why, if I were only to give you even the shortest and dryest
botanic description of all the different palms that are known to us,
that mere dry catalogue would fill a book as big as this one!</p>

<p>How many species do you think there are? Up to this time you
have thought, perhaps, there was only one, and that was <i>the palm-tree
itself</i>. Maybe you have heard of more, such as the sago-palm,
the cocoa-nut palm, the date-palm, or the cabbage-palm; and you
fancied there might be others&mdash;perhaps as many as a dozen! Now
you will hardly credit me when I tell you that we know of no less
than <i>six hundred species of palms</i>, all differing from each other! I
may add, further, that it is my belief that there exist on the earth as
many more&mdash;that is, the enormous number of twelve hundred.</p>

<p>The reason why I entertain this belief is, that in all cases where
similar guesses have been hazarded&mdash;whether with regard to plants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
or birds, or <i>mammalia</i>&mdash;they have eventually proved far below the
mark; and as the palm countries are the very regions of the earth
least known and least explored by botanists, it is but reasonable to
conclude that great numbers of species have never yet been described,
nor even seen. Another fact which strengthens this probability is,
that peculiar species of palms are sometimes found only in a limited
district, and nowhere else in the same country. A small river even
sometimes forms the boundary-line of a species; and although whole
groves may be seen on the one side, not a tree of the same sort grows
on the other. Some botanists even prognosticate that more than
two thousand species of palms will yet become known.</p>

<p>Of the six hundred species known, about half belong to the Old
World, and half to America. In America they are chiefly found
growing on the Continent&mdash;although several species are natives of
the West India Islands&mdash;while on the Eastern hemisphere the greatest
number of species belong to the islands.</p>

<p>I might tell you a great deal of the importance of these noble trees
to the human race, for they are as useful as they are beautiful.
Almost every sort has its particular use in the economy of human
life. Not only do they serve certain purposes in Africa, Asia,
America, and Oceanica, but in all these divisions of the earth there
are whole nations who <i>live almost exclusively</i> upon one or another
species of palm.</p>

<p>A discovery has lately been made in regard to an African species,
which it is to be hoped will have an important influence in doing
away with the infamous slave traffic so long existing in that unhappy
country. You have heard of <i>palm-oil</i>. Well, it is extracted from the
nuts of a species of palm. The oil is no new discovery, but it is only
lately that it has been found to be as quite as good for the manufacture
of candles as either spermaceti or wax.</p>

<p>The consequence has been a great increase in the traffic of this
article on the western coast of Africa; and the native princes, finding
that it is more profitable than slave-selling, have in many parts given
up the last-named atrocious commerce, and have taken to gathering
palm-oil. If a palm-tree can effect what has baffled the skill of the
combined philanthropists and powers of Europe, then, indeed, we
shall say, &ldquo;All honour to the noble palms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I might go on talking of palms until our little volume came to
an end. I must, therefore, no longer speak generally of these beautiful
trees, but confine myself to such species as came under the
observation, and ministered to the wants, of the new settlers.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="cap">A HOUSE OF PALMS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he first species of palms that attracted the observation of Don
Pablo and his party, was that known as the &ldquo;patawa&rdquo; palm. It
belongs to the genus <i>&#338;nocarpus</i>. There are several species of this
genus in South America, but none more beautiful than the &ldquo;patawa.&rdquo;
It is a palm with a straight smooth stem, and pinnate leaves&mdash;the
stem being sixty feet in height, and about a foot in diameter. The
stem becomes smooth only in old trees. In the young ones, and even
in those that stand in a thick shady forest, it presents a very shaggy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
appearance, and is completely hidden by the bases of the old leaves
that have decayed and fallen off. From the margins of these bases
grow spinous processes of nearly three feet in length, which point
upward. These are used by the Indians to make the arrows of their
&ldquo;blow-guns,&rdquo; of which more hereafter.</p>

<p>From the fruits of this palm a most delicious drink is manufactured
with very little trouble. The fruit itself is about the size of a plum,
but of an oval shape and deep violet colour. It grows in large
clusters just under the leaves. To make the drink, the fruits are
thrown into a vessel of hot water, where they remain for a few
minutes until the pulp becomes soft. The hot water is next poured
off, and cold water is substituted. In this the fruits are crushed and
rubbed with the hands until all the pulp is washed from the stones.
The liquid is then strained so as to separate the stones and other
substances, when it is ready for use, and a most luxurious beverage
it is,&mdash;in its taste bearing some resemblance to filberts and cream.</p>

<p>A palm called the &ldquo;ass&aacute;i&rdquo; has a small sloe-like fruit which produces
a similar beverage&mdash;thick and creamy, and of a fine plum
colour. In all the Portuguese settlements the &ldquo;ass&aacute;i&rdquo; is a favourite
drink, and is taken along with cassava bread, as we use milk or
coffee.</p>

<p>It was not on account of its fruit, however, that Don Pablo rejoiced
at beholding the &ldquo;patawa&rdquo; palms. Perhaps Leon thought more
about the rich clusters of oval plums, but his father looked only to
the straight smooth stems which were designed for corner-posts,
beams, and the heavier woodwork of the house.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Guapo was busy with his axe, and one after
another fell the princely trunks of the &ldquo;patawa&rdquo; until enough were
cut down for their purpose.</p>

<p>Don Pablo next looked out for some palm of a more slender trunk
for the rafters and joists.</p>

<p>This was soon found in the &ldquo;catinga,&rdquo; which is a species of the
&ldquo;ass&aacute;i palm, the one of which we have just spoken as producing the
ass&aacute;i wine.&rdquo; The catinga was the very thing for the rafters. It is
tall, nearly forty feet high, but quite slender. It is one of the
smooth palms, with pinnate leaves, not unlike those of the &ldquo;patawa.&rdquo;
There is a peculiarity about its top,&mdash;that is, there is a column or
sheath of several feet in length, out of which the leaves spring, and,
at the lower end of this column, and not immediately at the root
of the leaves, the fruit clusters grow. This sheathing column is of
a red colour, which gives the tree a strange look.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of the catinga is that its roots grow out of the
ground, and form a little cone from the top of which rises the stem.
The fruits of this sort are smaller than the true ass&aacute;i, but a drink is
also made from them which some people consider more delicious than
that either of the ass&aacute;i or patawa. The rafters then were got from
the catinga.</p>

<p>Now for the thatch, that was the next consideration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo; cried Guapo, pointing off into the woods. &ldquo;Yonder's
'bussu,'&mdash;very thing for thatch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guapo indicated a very singular-looking tree, with a thick, clumsy,
crooked, and deeply ringed stem. It was not a bit like either of the
palm-trees they had already cut down. Its trunk was not over ten
or a dozen feet high, but then, such leaves! They were not pinnated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
like those already described, but what is termed &ldquo;entire,&rdquo; that is, all
in one piece, and thirty feet in length by full five in width! Fancy
two or three dozen of these gigantic leaves standing up almost erect
from the top of the thick trunk, and you may form some idea of the
&ldquo;bussu&rdquo; palm. There are many palm-trees whose leaves are used for
thatching houses, but of all others for that purpose the bussu is the
best.</p>

<p>These great fronds have a mid-rib, and from this, on both sides,
run veins in a diagonal direction to the edge. When they are used
for thatch the leaf is split up the mid-rib, and then each half is laid
upon the rafters, not straight, but in such a way that the veins of the
leaf will lie in a vertical direction, and thus serve as gutters to guide
the rain-water down the roof. A very few leaves will thatch a house,
and a covering of this kind, when properly laid on, will last for ten
or twelve years. So much are the bussu-leaves prized for thatch,
that the Indians, in parts where this palm does not grow, often make
a canoe voyage of a week to procure them!</p>

<p>The spathe which contains the flowers is also put to many uses.
It is of a long spindle shape, of fibrous, cloth-like texture, and brown
colour. The Indians use it as cloth. It makes an excellent bag, in
which the native carries his paints or other articles; and a large one,
stretched out, makes a very comfortable cap. Indeed, Guapo used
the first spathe he laid his hands upon for this very purpose.</p>

<p>There remained now to be found some palm-tree that would split
easily, and make laths for the roof, as well as planks for the door,
shelves, and benches. They soon discovered the very palm for these
purposes. It was one of the genus <i>Iriartea</i>, and known as the
&ldquo;pashiuba&rdquo; palm. It was a tree that differed from all the others in
its aspect. It was a noble-looking tree, rising, with a smooth stem,
to the height of seventy feet. At its top, there was a sheathing
column swollen larger than the stem, and not unlike the sheathing
column of the catinga already mentioned, except that that of the
pashiuba was of a deep green colour. Its leaves, however, differed
materially from those of the catinga. It is true, that, like them, they
were pinnate, but the leaflets, instead of being slender and tapering,
were of a triangular shape, notched along the edges, and not growing
very regularly out from the mid-rib.</p>

<p>Their general arrangement, as well as the form, therefore, gave the
tree a different, and, perhaps, more beautiful aspect. But the most
singular characteristic of the pashiuba was its roots. I have said
that the roots of the catinga rose above the surface of the soil. So
did they, but only to a limited height, forming a little cone. Now
the roots of the pashiuba stood up to the height of ten or a dozen
feet! Each root was nearly straight in itself, but there were a
number of them, and they sloped upwards so as to make a sort of
pyramid, out of the apex of which grew the stem. There were wide
spaces between the roots&mdash;so wide that you could easily pass through,
and a full-grown man might stand upright with his head under the
very base of the stem. Fancy a man standing under the trunk of a
tree that rose seventy feet above his head!</p>

<p>There were young trees of the same species growing around, and
these were miniature models of the older ones. Sometimes these
lesser ones are supported on three roots, like the tripod of a surveyor's
compass, and this gives them a somewhat ludicrous appearance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
There are many species of this sort of palms, which are classed
under the genus <i>Iriartea</i>. In most of them the fruit, which is small
oval and red or yellow, is bitter and uneatable; but their wood is
prized for many purposes. The wood of the species which Don Pablo
had found is hard on the outside, but soft within, and splits readier
into laths and planks than any other kind of palm.</p>

<p>Guapo attacked the roots with his axe, and enough trunks were
soon felled to make laths, doors, and all sorts of benches.</p>

<p>The different kinds were now collected on the edge of the stream,
and were tied together by a rope-like, creeping plant, called a &ldquo;Sipo,&rdquo;
so that they formed a rude raft. The leaves of the &ldquo;bussu,&rdquo; with
great clusters of the fruits of the catinga and patawa, were laid upon
the raft; and then, Guapo, mounting himself on top of all, pushed
out with his long pole, and ferried the whole across. The others
walked round by the bridge, and were just in time to assist Guapo
in mooring his somewhat unwieldy craft.</p>

<p>Next day the framework of the house was put up, and on the day
after the walls. These were made of bamboo-canes, plenty of which
grew near the bottom of the valley. They grew wild, for the slopes
of the Andes are the favourite soil of these gigantic grasses. They
were set on end, side by side, and then tied to each other and to the
beams of palm-trees. On the third day the &ldquo;bussu&rdquo; leaves were laid
on, and the house was finished.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">TRACKING THE TAPIR.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span>t has been already mentioned that the stream in front of the house
was wider than at other parts, forming a sort of lake. There was a
slow current down the middle, but at the sides the water was nearly
stagnant, and there grew in some places bunches of flags interspersed
with beautiful white lilies. Among these could be distinguished that
gigantic <i>nympha</i> so celebrated under the name of <i>Victoria regia</i>&mdash;for
South America is the native country of this rare plant.</p>

<p>Every night, as our party were resting from their labours, they
heard strange noises proceeding from the water. There was plunging
and plashing, and now and then a snorting sound like that sometimes
uttered by frightened swine. Perhaps it would have puzzled any of
them to tell whence these sounds proceeded, or what animal gave
utterance to them, for there could be no doubt they were caused by
an animal. Some of them guessed &ldquo;alligators;&rdquo; but that was not a
correct guess, for although there are plenty of alligators in all the
rivers of tropical America, there seemed to be none in that particular
place.</p>

<p>In truth, they might have remained long in the dark about what
creature they thus heard sweltering about nightly, for they could
neither see nor hear anything of it in the day; but Guapo, who knew
every sound of the Monta&ntilde;a, enlightened them at once. Guapo had
been a keen <i>tapir-hunter</i> in his time, and understood all the habits of
that strange animal. It was a tapir, then, which they had heard
taking his regular nightly bath, and regaling himself on the roots of
the flags and <i>nymph&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a tapir? Not a living one, I fancy; perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
the skin of one in a museum. He is an interesting creature, for this
reason&mdash;that he is the largest land animal indigenous to South
America. The llama and guanaco stand higher because their legs are
longer, and they are far inferior to the tapir in bulk and weight:
while the bears of South America, of which there are two or three
species, are small-sized bears, and therefore less than the tapir. In
fact, no very large land animals were found indigenous in the southern
division of the American continent. There were none of the <i>bovine</i>
tribe, as the buffalo and musk-ox of North America; and no large
deer, as the elk and moose of the Northern latitudes. The deer of
South America, of which there are several undescribed species, are
all small animals. The tapir, then, in point of size takes precedence
in the South-American <i>fauna</i>.</p>

<p>His rounded body gives him some resemblance to a great hog, or a
donkey with its hair shaved off; but, in fact, he is not very like
either; he is more like a <i>tapir</i> than anything else&mdash;that is, he is a
creature <i>sui generis</i>. Perhaps, if you were to shave a large donkey,
cut off most part of his ears and tail, shorten his limbs&mdash;and, if
possible, make them stouter and clumsier&mdash;lengthen his upper jaw so
that it should protrude over the under one into a prolonged curving
snout, and then give him a coat of blackish-brown paint, you would
get something not unlike a tapir.</p>

<p>To complete the resemblance, however, you would have to continue
the erect mane over the forehead, between the ears, and down to the
level of the eyes, which would give that crested appearance that
characterises the tapir. Instead of hoofs, moreover, you would give
your donkey large toes&mdash;four upon the fore feet, and upon the hind
ones three. A little silky hair upon the stumped tail, and a few
thinly scattered hairs of a brown colour over the body, would make
the likeness still more striking; and it would be necessary, too, that
the donkey be one of the very biggest kind to be as big as a big tapir.</p>

<p>The tapir is a harmless creature, and although it has a good set of
teeth, it never uses them for the purpose of defending itself. When
attacked by either men or fierce animals, it tries to escape by flight,
and if that fails, submits to be killed; but there is no &ldquo;fight&rdquo; to be
got out of a tapir.</p>

<p>The tapir leads a very solitary life, being met with alone, or sometimes
in the company of the female. The latter has but one young
at a birth, which follows her until able to provide for itself; when
they associate no longer together, but part company, each taking its
own way.</p>

<p>This animal is called amphibious, because it spends part of its time
in the water; but, although it has been called the American representative
of the rhinoceros and hippopotamus, it is not so much a
water animal as either of these. It seeks its food in the river, or the
marshes that border it, and can remain for several minutes under
water; but for all that most of its time is passed on dry land. It
sleeps during the day in some dry spot upon a bed of withered leaves,
from whence it sallies every evening, and makes to the marshy banks
of some well-known stream. It frequently leaves its lair during rain,
and goes in search of food. Like hogs it is very fond of wallowing in
a muddy place; but, unlike these slovenly animals, it does not return
to its bed until it has plunged into the clear water, and thoroughly
purified itself of the mud.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>One habit of the tapir&mdash;and an unfortunate one for itself&mdash;is that
in going its rounds it always follows the old track. In this way a
path is soon formed from its lair to its feeding-place, so conspicuous
that a hunter might trail it upon the run. It is easy, therefore, to
&ldquo;waylay&rdquo; a tapir. Guapo knew this well, and had already, while
over among the palms, marked the track of the one that came nightly
to the stream, and had settled it in his mind that that particular
tapir had not many days to live. In fact, Leon coaxed him to fix the
tapir-hunt for the next morning, which Guapo, with Don Pablo's
permission, accordingly did.</p>

<p>Guapo was anxious as any of them to kill the tapir, for, like many
Indians, he was fond of its flesh, though that is by no means a palatable
article of food. On the contrary, it is dry, and to most people
tastes disagreeably. Guapo, however, liked it exceedingly; and,
moreover, he wanted the tough skin for some purpose of his own.
The wild Indians value the skin highly, as it is the best thing they
can procure for &ldquo;viches,&rdquo; or shields, to ward off the poisoned arrows
of their enemies.</p>

<p>Next morning, an hour or so after daybreak, Guapo started for the
hunt, accompanied by Leon. Don Pablo remained at home with his
wife and the little Leona. Now, had the tapir-hunter possessed a
gun, or even a bow and arrows, his plan of proceedings would have
been different, and he would no doubt have chosen a different hour
for the hunt. He would have chosen the twilight of the evening or
morning, and would have hid himself in the bushes, so as to command
a view of the track which the tapir would be certain to take on his
way to or from the water. He would then have simply shot the
creature as it was going past; but this is not so easy a matter neither,
for the tapir, fearful of enemies while on land, always travels at a
trot. As Guapo had neither bow nor gun, nothing in fact but his
<i>machet&eacute;</i>, how was he to get near enough to use this weapon? Clumsy-looking
as the tapir certainly is, he can shuffle over the ground faster
than the fastest Indian.</p>

<p>Guapo knew all this, but he also knew a stratagem by which the
amphibious brute could be outwitted, and this stratagem he designed
putting in practice. For the purpose he carried another weapon
besides the <i>machet&eacute;</i>. That weapon was a very pacific one&mdash;it was
a <i>spade</i>! Fortunately he had one which he had brought with him
from the mountains.</p>

<p>Now what did Guapo mean to do with the spade? The tapir
is not a burrowing animal, and therefore would not require to
be &ldquo;dug out.&rdquo; We shall presently see what use was made of the
spade.</p>

<p>After crossing the bridge, and getting well round among the
palms, the hunter came upon a path well tracked into the mud. It
was the path of the tapir,&mdash;that could be easily seen. There were
the broad footmarks&mdash;some with three, and others with four toes&mdash;and
there, too, were places where the animal had &ldquo;wallowed.&rdquo; The
tracks were quite fresh, and made, as Guapo said, not an hour before
they had arrived on the spot.</p>

<p>This was just what the tapir-hunter wanted; and, choosing a
place where the track ran between two palm-trees, and could not
well have gone round either of them, he halted, rested his <i>machet&eacute;</i>
against a tree, and took a determined hold of the spade. Leon now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
began to see what use he intended to make of the spade. He was
<i>going to dig a pit</i>!</p>

<p>That was, in fact, the very thing he was going to do, and in less
than an hour, with the help of Leon, it was done&mdash;the latter carrying
away the earth upon &ldquo;bussu&rdquo; leaves as fast as Guapo shovelled it
out. When the pit was sunk to what Guapo considered a sufficient
depth, he came out of it; and then choosing some slender poles,
with palm-leaves, branches, and grass, he covered it in such a manner
that a fox himself would not have known it to be a pit-trap. But
such it was&mdash;wide enough and deep enough, as Guapo deemed, to
entrap the largest tapir.</p>

<p>It now only remained to get the tapir into it, but therein lay the
difficulty. Leon could not understand how this was to be managed.
He knew that at night, as the animal was on its way to the water, it
might step on the covering, and fall in. But Guapo had promised
him that he should see the tapir trapped in an hour's time. Guapo
had a plan of his own for bringing it that way, and he at once
proceeded to put his plan into execution.</p>

<p>They started along the trail going <i>from</i> the water, and towards
the lair of the beast. The hunter knew it would not be very distant&mdash;perhaps
a quarter or half-a-mile, perhaps less. Before starting he
cautioned Leon to keep close behind him, and not to make the least
noise. So little as a whisper or the rustling of the brush, he alleged,
might spoil all his plans. Guapo marched, or rather crouched, along;
at first freely, but after some time his step grew more stealthy and
cautious. He knew that he was getting near to his sleeping victim.</p>

<p>After stopping and repeating his caution to his companion, he
proceeded as before until they had got better than a quarter of
a mile from the water. Here they began to ascend a gentle hill,
where the ground was dry, and strewed with fallen trees. At some
places the trail was difficult to make out, and Leon would soon have
lost it had he been left to himself. But there was no fear of Guapo
losing it. A hound could not have followed it more surely.</p>

<p>Suddenly Guapo stopped&mdash;then went on a few steps&mdash;then stopped
a second time, and made a sign for Leon to come up. Without
speaking, he pointed to a little thicket of scrubby bushes, through
the leaves of which they could just make out some large brown
object perfectly at rest. That was the tapir himself&mdash;sound asleep.</p>

<p>Guapo had already instructed his companion that when they
should arrive near the den of the animal, they were to make a wide
circuit around&mdash;Leon going one way, while he himself took the
other. Both now drew back a little, and then parted&mdash;the hunter
going to one side, and Leon in the opposite direction. After making
their circuit, they met at some distance beyond the back of the den;
and then Guapo, telling the other to follow him, and, without
observing any further caution, walked straight towards where the
tapir lay.</p>

<p>The Indian knew by experience that the latter, when roused,
would make directly along its accustomed trail to the water, for to
the water it always flies when alarmed by an enemy. When they
had got within a few paces of the den, a movement was seen among
the leaves&mdash;then a crackling noise was heard, as the huge body of the
animal broke through the bushes, and took to flight. He did not
trot according to his usual gait, but went off in a gallop, with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
head carried in a singular and awkward manner between his fore-legs!
You have, no doubt, seen a donkey sometimes gallop in a
similar style.</p>

<p>Guapo bounded after, followed by Leon, who kept close at his
heels. Of course the tapir was in sight only a few seconds, but the
hunter knew that he would take the beaten track, and therefore was
at no loss. They made no unnecessary noise&mdash;lest the tapir might
be frightened from its path&mdash;but ran on in silence.</p>

<p>They soon got back to the pit-fall, Guapo of course leading the
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hola!&rdquo; cried the latter, when he came in sight of it, &ldquo;hola,
young master! he's in the trap!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough he was; and the next moment they stood upon the
edge of the pit, and beheld the great brown body struggling and
tumbling about at the bottom.</p>

<p>Guapo did not pause a moment, but leaped in, <i>machet&eacute;</i> in hand.
He had no fear of the animal biting him, for he knew it would not
do so; but Guapo, in his hurry, had leaped carelessly, and his foot
slipping, he fell over the smooth body of the tapir. The latter in its
fright jumped upward, and the next moment Guapo was <i>undermost</i>
at the bottom of the pit!</p>

<p>The animal had no design of trampling the hunter; but seeing
that it could easily leap out&mdash;the pit being shallowed for it by
Guapo's body and the fallen branches&mdash;it made a spring, and came
out on the edge. Leon had got round upon the side next the river,
but he chanced to be on the wrong side just then; for the heavy
tapir dashing past, knocked against him, and sent him sprawling
among the trees. Before he could recover himself, or Guapo climb
out of the pit, a loud plunge in the water announced that the animal
had escaped to an element where it might defy their pursuit.</p>

<p>Both were quite crest-fallen and disappointed, but Guapo especially
so. He had prided himself very much on his skill as a tapir-hunter,
and his pride was mortified at the result. He seemed very much
chagrined; and as he and Leon returned toward the house, he
stopped at intervals and looked into the water. Then shaking his
machet&eacute; in a threatening manner, cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dive away, old thick-skin! Dive deep as you will, I'll have your
hide yet!&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE POISONED ARROWS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he result of the tapir chase determined Guapo to have himself
better armed. There was one weapon&mdash;and a very efficient one too&mdash;which
he knew how both to make and use. That weapon was
a &ldquo;gravat&aacute;na,&rdquo; or blow-gun, sometimes called &ldquo;pocuna.&rdquo; He had
had an eye to this weapon all along, and had already provided the
materials necessary for making it. These materials were of a varied
character, and had cost him some trouble in getting them together.</p>

<p>First, then, for the blow-tube itself he had cut stems of a slender
palm-tree, a species of <i>Iriartea</i>, but not that sort already described.
It was the <i>Pashiuba miri</i> of the Indians. This little palm grows to
the height of from twelve to twenty feet, and is never thicker than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
a man's wrist. Its roots, like the others of its genus, rise above the
ground, but only a few inches. The stems which Guapo had chosen
were of different sizes. One was about the thickness of the handle
of a garden-rake, while the other was not over the diameter of a
walking-cane. Both were hollow in the heart, or rather they
contained pith like the alder-tree, which when forced out left a
smooth bore.</p>

<p>Having cut these stems to a length of about ten feet, and pushed
out the pith, Guapo inserted the smaller one into the bore of the
larger, which fitted tightly all the way&mdash;for he had chosen it of the
proper thickness to this end. The object of thus using two stems
instead of one will not, at first, be understood. It was for the purpose
of making the tube perfectly straight, as this is a most important
consideration in the gravat&aacute;na. The outer and stronger stem corrected
any bend that there might be in the inner one, and they were
carefully arranged so that the one should straighten the other.</p>

<p>Had it not been perfectly straight, Guapo would have bound it to
a post and made it so; but it happened to come quite right without
further trouble. The tube of the lesser one was now cleaned out
thoroughly, and polished by a little bunch of the roots of a tree-fern,
until it was as smooth and hard as ebony. A mouthpiece of wood
was placed at the smaller end of the table, and a sight was glued on
the outside. This &ldquo;sight&rdquo; was the tooth of an animal,&mdash;one of the
long curving incisors of a rodent animal called the &ldquo;paca,&rdquo; which is
found in most parts of tropical America. To make the instrument
look neater, Guapo had procured the tough shining bark of a creeping
plant, which he wound spirally around the outside from the mouthpiece
to the muzzle; and then the gravat&aacute;na was finished.</p>

<p>There was yet much to be done before it could be used. Arrows
were to be made, and a quiver in which to carry them, and poison to
dip their points in&mdash;for the arrows of the blow-gun do not kill
by the wound they inflict, but by the poison with which they are
charged.</p>

<p>The next thing, then, to which Guapo turned his attention was the
manufacture of the arrows. These can be made of cane, reeds, and
other kinds of wood; but the best materials for the purpose are the
long spines of the patawa palm, of which I have already spoken.
These spines grow out from the lower part of the leaf-petioles, and, in
young trees and those much sheltered, remain upon the trunk, giving
it a very shaggy appearance. They are often three feet in length,
about as thick as large wire, rather flattish, and of a black colour.
To make the arrows, Guapo cut them to the length of fifteen or
eighteen inches, and then pointed them sharply at one end. About
three inches from the points he notched them all, so that they would
break in the wound rather than drop out again, in consequence of the
struggles of the animal.</p>

<p>About two or three inches from the thick end of the arrow Guapo
wrapped lightly around the shaft some strands of the soft silky
cotton, which he had procured from the pods of the great &ldquo;ceiba,&rdquo; or
silk-cotton tree, already mentioned. This he fastened on with a fibre
of an aloe plant&mdash;one of the <i>bromelias</i>; and the cotton, when thus
secured, assumed a conical or spindle shape, having its larger end
towards the butt of the arrow. When inserted into the gravat&aacute;na,
the swell of the cotton filled the tube exactly,&mdash;not so tightly as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
impede the passage of the arrow, nor so loosely as to allow of &ldquo;windage&rdquo;
when blown upon through the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>The arrows were now ready, with the exception of the poison for
their tips; and this was the most important of all, for without it both
blow-gun and arrows would have been useless weapons, indeed. But
Guapo was just the man who knew how to make this poison, and that
is more than could be said of every Indian, for it is only the &ldquo;piaches&rdquo;
(priests, or &ldquo;medicine-men&rdquo;) who understand the process. Nay, more,
there are even some tribes where not an individual knows how the
arrow-poison is made; and these have to procure it by barter from
others, paying a high price, and sometimes going a great distance
for it.</p>

<p>This celebrated poison is known under different names, but those
of &ldquo;curare,&rdquo; &ldquo;ticuna,&rdquo; and &ldquo;wouraly,&rdquo; are the principal.</p>

<p>It is one of the most deadly poisons yet discovered&mdash;as much so as
the <i>upastiente</i> of Java, or the bean of St. Ignatius&mdash;but it is perfectly
harmless when swallowed, and, indeed, it is often taken by the
Indians as an excellent stomachic. Should it get into the blood, however,
by means of an arrow-wound, or a sore, no remedy has yet been
discovered that will cure it. Death is certain, and a death similar to
that caused by the bite of a venomous serpent. So say those who
have suffered from it, but recovered on account of their having been
only slightly wounded, or lightly inoculated with it. Let us see, then,
how Guapo prepared this deadly mixture.</p>

<p>He had gone out to the forest, and returned carrying a bundle of
slender rods. They were pieces of a lliana, or creeping plant. It was
the <i>bejuco de curare</i>, or &ldquo;mavacure,&rdquo; as it is sometimes called. The
leaves he had stripped off, and left behind as useless. Had he brought
them with him, they would have been seen to be small leaves of an
oblong-oval shape, sharp at the points, and of a whittish-green colour.
Don Pablo knew the plant to be a species of <i>Strychnos</i>.</p>

<p>Guapo with his knife first scraped all the bark, as well as the
alburnum or white coating, from the rods, which last he flung away.
The mixture of bark and alburnum was next placed upon a smooth
stone, and mashed into a fibre of a yellowish colour. This done, it
was gathered into a heap, and placed within a funnel, which had
already been made out of a plantain-leaf. The funnel was a long
narrow cone, and to strengthen it, it was set within another funnel
made of the thick leaf of the &ldquo;bussu&rdquo; palm, and then both were
supported by a framework of palm fibres.</p>

<p>Underneath the apex was placed a small pan&mdash;which could afterwards
be put over the fire&mdash;and then cold water was thrown into the
funnel along with the bark. A yellowish liquid soon commenced to
filter and drip into the pan, and this liquid was the <i>curare</i>, the arrow
poison. It still required, however, to be concentrated by evaporation;
and for this purpose the pan was transferred to a slow fire,
where it was kept until the liquid became thickened by the heat.</p>

<p>Another process was yet required before the curare was ready for
the arrows. It was sufficiently concentrated and deadly, but still too
thin to adhere properly to their tips, and for this purpose a mixture
of some gummy juice was necessary. This Guapo soon prepared from
the large leaves of a tree called the &ldquo;kiracaguero,&rdquo; and poured it into
the infusion; and then the curare turned from its yellow colour to
black, and was ready for use. The change of colour was produced by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
the decomposition of a hydruret of carbon; the hydrogen was burned,
and the carbon set free.</p>

<p>Guapo now dipped a few of his arrows, and carefully deposited
them in a large joint of bamboo, which served as a quiver. I say
<i>carefully</i>, for had one of these arrows dropped with its poisoned point
upon his naked foot, or wounded him elsewhere, he never would have
prepared any more curare. But he handled them with care, and the
remainder of the liquid he poured into a small gourd (similar to that
in which he carried his coca-lime), which he closely corked up with a
piece of the pith from a palm.</p>

<p>Don Pablo, with Do&ntilde;a Isidora and the children, had watched with
interest all this process. At first, they were afraid to go near, believing
that the fumes of the liquid might be injurious. This was long
believed to be the case, in consequence of the absurd tales spread
abroad by the old missionaries, and even at a later period by the
traveller La Condamine. These asserted, that when the Indians
wished to make the curare poison, they selected for this purpose the
old women of the tribe, whose lives were not deemed of any value;
and that several of these always fell a sacrifice while &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; the
curare!</p>

<p>This silly story is now refuted; and Guapo not only assured his
companions that there was no danger, but even tasted the curare
from time to time while in the pan, in order to judge when it was
sufficiently concentrated. This he could tell by its taste, as it grew
more and more bitter as the evaporation proceeded. The arrow-poisons
of South America are not all made from the creeping plant,
the mavacure. Among some Indian tribes a root is used called
&ldquo;curare de raiz;&rdquo; and with others the poison is produced by a mixture
of several species of juices from the plant <i>Ambihuasca</i>, tobacco, red
pepper, a bark called &ldquo;barbasco,&rdquo; from a tree of the genus <i>Jacquinia</i>,
and a plant of the name &ldquo;sarnango.&rdquo; Of all these the juice of the
<i>Ambihuasca</i> is the most powerful ingredient, but the making of this
species of poison is a most complicated process.</p>

<p>Guapo was not long in having an opportunity to test his gravat&aacute;na,
and this was just what he desired, for the old Indian was not a little
vain of his skill, and he wished to make a show of it in the eyes of
his companions. His vanity, however, was the more pardonable, as
he was in reality a first-rate shot, which he proved to the satisfaction
of everybody within half-an-hour. The instrument had scarcely been
finished and laid aside, when a loud screaming and chattering was
heard in the air, and on looking up a flock of large birds was seen
flying over the heavens. They were still high up, but all of a sudden
they darted down together and alit on a tall tree that stood nearly
alone.</p>

<p>Here they continued their chattering, only in a lower and more
confidential tone; and they could be seen, not hopping, but climbing
about, sometimes with their backs and heads turned downward, and,
in short, clinging to the branches in every imaginable way. These
birds were all of one kind, each of them full eighteen inches in
length, and of a uniform colour over the body, which was a purple,
or deep indigo&mdash;their beaks only being white. In the sun their
plumage glistened with a metallic lustre. They were, in fact, a rare
species,&mdash;the <i>ana</i>, or <i>purple macaw</i>.</p>

<p>Without saying a word, Guapo seized his gravat&aacute;na and arrows,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
and stole off through the underwood towards the tree upon which
the macaws had perched. In a few minutes he stood under it,
screened from the view of the birds by the broad leaves of a plantain
that happened to grow beneath. This cover was necessary, else the
macaws, which are shy birds, might have uttered one of their wild,
choral screams, and flown off. They did not, however, and Guapo
had a fair chance at them. All his movements could be observed by
the party at the house, as he was on that side of the plantain.</p>

<p>He was seen to adjust an arrow into the tube, and then raise the
gravat&aacute;na to his lips. Strange to say, he did not hold it as we do a
common gun,&mdash;that is, with the left hand advanced along the tube.
On the contrary, both hands were held nearly together, at the lower
end, and close to his mouth. Now, you will wonder how he could
hold such a long tube steady in this way. It is, indeed, a very
difficult thing, and much practice alone can accomplish it. As they
watched him narrowly, his chest was seen to expand, his cheeks
rose with a strong &ldquo;puff,&rdquo; and some of them thought they could
perceive the passage of the little arrow out of the tube.</p>

<p>However this might be, they soon after saw something sticking in
the side of one of the macaws, and could see the bird pecking at it
with its great beak, and trying to pull it out. In this it appeared to
have succeeded after a short while, for something fell from the tree.
It was the shaft with its cotton &ldquo;boss&rdquo; that fell down. The point,
broken off where it had been notched, was still in the body of the
bird, and was infusing the deadly venom into its veins. In about
two minutes' time the wounded bird seemed to grow giddy, and
began to stagger. It then fell over, still clutching the branch with
its strong, prehensile claws; but after hanging a moment, these too
relaxed, and the body fell heavily to the ground. It was quite dead.</p>

<p>Long before it came down Guapo had pushed a fresh arrow into
the tube, and given a fresh puff through it, wounding a second of
the macaws. Then another arrow was chosen, and another victim,
until several had been shot, and the creatures upon the tree could be
seen in all stages of dying. Some, on receiving the wound, uttered
a cry and flew off, but the poison soon brought them down, and they
invariably fell at no great distance from the tree.</p>

<p>At length Guapo was seen to desist, and walk boldly out from his
ambush. To the surprise of all, the remaining macaws, of which
there were still six or seven upon the tree, showed no fear of him, nor
did they attempt to fly away! This was explained, however, by
their subsequent conduct; for in a few seconds more they were seen,
one by one, falling to the ground, until not a single bird was left
upon the tree. All of them had been killed by the arrows of the
blow-gun!</p>

<p>Leon now ran out to assist Guapo in gathering his game. There
were no less than eight couple of them in all, and they were all quite
dead&mdash;some of them shot in the thigh, some in the neck or wing, and
others through the body. None of them had lived over two minutes
after receiving the wound. Such is the quickness with which the
&ldquo;curare&rdquo; does its work!</p>

<p>As a hunting instrument for most species of game the South
American Indian prefers the gravat&aacute;na to any other; and with good
reason. Had Guapo been armed with a rifle or fowling-piece, he
would have shot one macaw, or perhaps a pair, and then the rest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
would have uttered a tantalising scream, and winged their way out
of his reach. He might have missed the whole flock, too, for on a
high tree, such as that on which they had alit, it is no easy matter to
kill a macaw with a shot-gun. Now the gravat&aacute;na throws its arrow
to a height of from thirty to forty yards, and the least touch is
sufficient to do the business. Its silence, moreover, enables the
hunter to repeat the shot, until several head of game reward his
skill. The Indians use it with most effect in a vertical or upward
direction; and they are always surer to kill a bird with it when
perched on a high tree, than when seated on a low shrub or on the
ground.</p>

<p>As we have observed that the curare can be taken inwardly without
any danger, it will be evident to all that game killed by the poisoned
arrows may be eaten with safety. Indeed, there are many epicures
in South America who prefer it in this way; and when a chicken is
wanted for the table, these people require that it should be killed by
an arrow dipped in curare.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE MILK-TREE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">G</span>uapo kept his promise with the tapir, and on that very same day.
Shortly after the macaws had been brought in, little Leona, who
had been straying down by the water's edge, came running back to
the house, and in breathless haste cried out, &ldquo;Mamma, mamma!
what a big hog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where, my pet?&rdquo; inquired her mother, with a degree of anxiety,
for she fancied that the child might have seen some fierce beast of
prey instead of a hog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the water,&rdquo; replied Leona; &ldquo;among the great lillies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's the tapir,&rdquo; cried Leon. &ldquo;Carrambo! it's our tapir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guapo was busy plucking his macaws, but at the word tapir he
sprang to his feet, making the feathers fly in all directions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where, se&ntilde;orita?&rdquo; he asked, addressing little Leona.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down below,&rdquo; replied the child; &ldquo;near the edge of the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guapo seized his gravat&aacute;na, and crouched down towards the bank,
with Leon at his heels. On nearing the water, he stopped; and,
with his body half-bent, looked down stream. There, sure enough,
was the huge brown beast standing with his body half out of the
water, and pulling up the roots of the flags with his great teeth and
long moveable snout. It was not likely he would return to his
former den after the chase he had had; and fancying, no doubt,
that all the danger lay upon the opposite shore, he had come to this
side to browse awhile.</p>

<p>Guapo cautioned Leon to remain where he was, while he himself,
almost crawling upon his belly, proceeded along the bank. In a few
minutes he was out of sight, and Leon, seeing nothing more of him,
kept his eyes sharply fixed upon the tapir.</p>

<p>The latter remained quietly feeding for about ten minutes, when
the boy saw him give a little start. Perhaps, thought he, he has
heard Guapo among the weeds&mdash;for the tapir has good ears&mdash;and
that was what caused him to make the motion. The tapir stopped
feeding for a moment, but then recommenced, though evidently not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
with as much eagerness as before. Presently he stopped a second
time, and seemed undetermined as to whether he should not turn
and take to the clear water. In this way he hesitated for several
minutes; then, to the astonishment of Leon, his body began to rock
from side to side, and the next moment, with a plunge, he fell
heavily backward, making the waves undulate on all sides of him.
The arrow had done its work&mdash;he was dead!</p>

<p>A loud shout from Guapo echoed along the river, and the Indian
was seen plunging forward to the dead tapir, which the next moment
he had seized by the leg, and was dragging towards the bank. He
was here met by the whole party, all of whom were anxious to see
this rare and singular creature. Ropes were soon attached to the
legs, and Guapo, assisted by Don Pablo and Leon, drew the huge
carcass out upon the shore; and dragged it up to the house.</p>

<p>Guapo at once skinned it, carefully preserving the hide to make
soles for his sandals and other purposes; and that night all of them
tried a &ldquo;tapir-steak&rdquo; for supper. All, however, Guapo alone excepted,
preferred the flesh of the purple macaws, which, cooked as
they were with onions and red pepper, were excellent eating, particularly
for Spanish-American palates. Guapo had all the tapir to himself.</p>

<p>The bamboo palm-house was now quite finished, and several articles
of furniture too&mdash;for during the nights both Don Pablo and his trusty
man Guapo had worked at many things. You will, no doubt, be
asking where they procured lights,&mdash;will you not? I shall tell you.
One of the loftiest and most beautiful of the palm-trees&mdash;<i>the wax-palm</i>&mdash;grew
in these very parts, for the lower slopes of the Andes are
its favourite habitat. Out of its trunk exudes wax, which has only
to be scraped off and made into candles, that burn as well as those
made of the wax of bees. Indeed, the missionaries, in their various
religious ceremonies, have always made large use of these palm-candles.</p>

<p>Another &ldquo;wax-palm,&rdquo; called &ldquo;Carn&aacute;uba,&rdquo; is found in South America.
In this one, the wax&mdash;of a pure white colour, and without any admixture
of resin&mdash;collects upon the under-side of the leaves, and can be
had in large quantities by merely stripping it off. But even, had
neither of these palms been found, they needed not to have gone
without lights, for the fruits of the &ldquo;patawa,&rdquo; already described, when
submitted to pressure, yield a pure liquid oil, without any disagreeable
smell, and most excellent for burning in lamps. So, you see,
there was no lack of light in the cheerful cottage.</p>

<p>But there were two things, you will say, still wanting&mdash;one of them
a necessary article, and the other almost so&mdash;and which could not
possibly be procured in such a place. These two things were <i>salt</i> and
<i>milk</i>. Now there was neither a salt-mine, nor a lake, nor a drop of
salt water, nor yet either cow, goat, or ass, within scores of miles of
the place, and still they had both salt and milk!</p>

<p>The milk they procured from a tree which grew in the woods close
by, and a tree so singular and celebrated, that you have no doubt
heard of it before now. It was the <i>palo de vaca</i>, or &ldquo;cow-tree,&rdquo; called
sometimes by an equally appropriate name <i>arbol del leche</i>, or &ldquo;milk-tree.&rdquo;
It is one of the noblest trees of the forest, rising, with its tall
straight stem, to a great height, and adorned with large oblong
pointed leaves, some of which are nearly a foot in length. It carries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
fruit which is eatable, about the size of a peach, and containing one
or two stones; and the wood itself is valuable, being hard, fine-grained,
and durable.</p>

<p>But it is the sap which gives celebrity to the tree. This is neither
more nor less than milk of a thick creamy kind, and most agreeable
in flavour. Indeed, there are many persons who prefer it to the milk
of cows, and it has been proved to be equally nutritious, the people
fattening upon it in districts where it grows. It is collected, as the
sugar-water is from the maple, simply by making a notch or incision
in the bark, and placing a vessel underneath, into which the sap runs
abundantly. It runs most freely at the hour of sunrise; and this is
also true as regards the sap of the sugar-tree, and many other trees
of that kind.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is drunk pure as it flows from the tree; but there are
some people who, not relishing it in its thick gummy state, dilute it
with water, and strain it before using it. It is excellent for tea or
coffee, quite equal to the best cream, and of a richer colour. When
left to stand in an open vessel, a thick coagulum forms on the top,
which the natives term cheese, and which they eat in a similar
manner, and with equal relish. Another virtue of this extraordinary
tree is that the cream, without any preparation, makes a glue for all
purposes as good as that used by cabinet-makers, and, indeed, Don
Pablo and Guapo had already availed themselves of it in this way.</p>

<p>So much for the <i>palo de vaca</i>.</p>

<p>It still remains for me to tell you where the <i>salt</i> came from; and
although the milk-tree was ever so welcome, yet the salt was a thing
of still greater necessity. Indeed, the latter might be looked upon as
an indispensable article in household economy. You, my young
reader, know not what it is to be without salt. With whole sacks of
this beautiful mineral within your reach, almost as cheap as sand,
you cannot fancy the longing&mdash;the absolute craving&mdash;for it, which
they feel who are for a period deprived of it.</p>

<p>Even the wild animals will make long journeys in search of those
salt-springs&mdash;or, as they are called, &ldquo;licks&rdquo;&mdash;which exist in many
places in the wilderness of America. For salt, Don Pablo and his
companions would have exchanged anything they had,&mdash;their sugar,
plantains, cocoa, coffee, or even the cassava, which was their bread.
They longed for salt, and knew not how they could get on without
it. The only substitute was the &ldquo;aji,&rdquo; or capsicum, of which several
species grew around, and almost every dish they ate was strongly
spiced with it. But still this was not salt, and they were not contented
with it.</p>

<p>It was now that they found a friend in Guapo. Guapo knew that
among many of the Indian tribes the fruit of a certain species of palm
was manufactured into salt; and he knew the palm, too, if he could
only get his eyes upon it. Seeing his master and the rest so troubled
upon this head, Guapo rose one morning early and stole off among the
groves of palm, on the other side of the river. There, in a marshy
place, with its roots even growing in the water, stood the very tree,&mdash;a
small palm of about four inches in diameter and twenty to thirty
feet high. It was thicker at the base than the top, and the top itself
rose several feet above the tuft of pinnate, feathery fronds, ending in
a pointed spike. It was the &ldquo;jara&rdquo; palm, of the genus <i>Leopoldinia</i>.</p>

<p>It was the fruits upon which Guapo bent his eyes with earnestness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Each one was as large as a peach, of an oval shape, slightly flattened,
and of a yellowish green colour. They grew in large clusters among
the bases of the leaves; and Guapo was not long in ascending several
trees&mdash;for the jara is a smooth-skinned palm, and can be climbed&mdash;and
breaking off the spadices, and flinging them to the ground. He
had soon collected a bag-full, with which he hurried back to the
house.</p>

<p>All wondered what Guapo meant to do with these fruits, for they
tasted them and found them very bitter. Guapo soon showed them
his intention. Having prepared a sort of furnace, he set the nuts on
fire; and when they were thoroughly reduced to ashes, to the great
joy and astonishment of all, these ashes, which were as white as flour,
had the taste of salt! It is true it was not equal to &ldquo;Turk's Island,&rdquo;
nor yet to &ldquo;Bay&rdquo; salt, but it proved to be good enough for cooking
purposes, and satisfied the craving which all had felt for this indispensable
article.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE CANNIBAL FISH AND THE GYMNOTUS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span>bout this time an incident occurred that was very near having a
fatal termination for one of the party&mdash;Leon. The day was a very
hot one, and as the cool water looked inviting, Leon could not resist
the temptation of taking a bath. Having undressed himself, he
plunged into the river nearly in front of where the house stood, and
began splashing about quite delighted. The rest were not heeding
him, as each was engaged with some occupation within the house.</p>

<p>Leon at first kept wading about in a place that was not beyond
his depth, but, by little and little, he took short swims, as he wished
to practise, and become a good swimmer like Guapo. His father had
not only given him permission, but had even advised him to do so.
And it may be here remarked that all parents would do well to take
the same course with their children and allow them to acquire this
healthful and useful art. No one can deny that thousands of lives
are annually sacrificed, because so few have taken the trouble to learn
swimming.</p>

<p>Well; Leon was determined to be a swimmer, and at each attempt
he made a wider stretch into the deep water, swam around, and then
back again to the bank.</p>

<p>In one of these excursions, just as he had got farthest out, all at
once he felt a sharp pain as if from the bite of some animal, and then
another, and another, upon different parts of the body, as if several
sets of teeth were attacking him at once!</p>

<p>Leon screamed&mdash;who wouldn't have done so?&mdash;and his scream
brought the whole household to the edge of the water in less than a
score of seconds. All of them believed that he was either drowning or
attacked by a crocodile. On arriving at the bank, however, they saw
that he was still above water, and swimming boldly for the shore&mdash;no
signs of a crocodile were to be seen!</p>

<p>What was the matter?</p>

<p>Of course that question was asked of him by them all in a breath.
His reply was that &ldquo;he could not tell&mdash;<i>something was biting him all
over</i>!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>The quick eye of the mother now caught sight of blood&mdash;around
the swimmer the water was tinged with it&mdash;her piercing shriek rent
the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O God! my child&mdash;my child! Save him&mdash;save him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both Don Pablo and Guapo dashed into the water and plunged
forward to meet him. In the next moment he was raised in their
arms, but the blood streamed down his body and limbs, apparently
from a dozen wounds. As they lifted him out of the water they saw
what had caused these wounds. A shoal of small fish, with ashy-green
backs and bright orange bellies and fins, was seen below.
With large open mouths they had followed their victim to the very
surface, and now that he was lifted out of their reach, they shot
forward and attacked the legs of his rescuers, causing Don Pablo and
Guapo to dance up in the water, and make with all haste for the
bank. As soon as they had reached it, they turned round and
looked into the water. There were these blood-thirsty pursuers that
had followed them up to the very bank, and now swam about darting
from point to point, and ready for a fresh attack on any one that
might enter the water!</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are the 'cannibal fish!'&rdquo; said Guapo, in an angry tone, as
he turned to attend to Leon. &ldquo;I shall punish them yet for it.
Trust me, young master, you shall be revenged!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leon was now carried up to the house, and it was found that in all
he had received nearly a dozen wounds! Some of them were on the
calves of his legs, where the piece of flesh was actually taken out!
Had he been farther out in the river, when first attacked, he might
never have reached the shore alive, as the fierce creatures were
gathering in far greater numbers when he was rescued, and would
most undoubtedly have torn him to pieces and eaten him up!</p>

<p>Such has been the fate of many persons who have fallen among the
&ldquo;cannibal fish&rdquo; in the midst of wide rivers where they had no chance
of escape. These ferocious little &ldquo;caribes,&rdquo; or &ldquo;caribitos,&rdquo; as they are
called (for the word <i>carib</i> signifies cannibal), lie at the bottom of
rivers, and are not easily seen; but the moment an attack is made by
one of them, and a drop of blood stains the water, the whole shoal
rises to the surface, and woe to the creature that is assailed by their
sharp triangular teeth!</p>

<p>Of course the wounds of Leon, although painful, were not dangerous,
but the chief danger lay in the loss of blood which was pouring from
so many veins. But Guapo found ready to his hand the best thing
in the world for stopping it. On some mimosa-trees, not far from
the house, he had already observed&mdash;indeed, so had all of them&mdash;a
very singular species of ants' nests of a yellowish brown colour. The
ants themselves were of a beautiful emerald green. They were the
<i>Formica spinicollis</i>. These nests were composed of a soft cotton-down,
which the ants had collected from a species of <i>Melastoma</i>, a
handsome shrub found growing in these regions; and this down
Guapo knew to be the best for blood-stopping.</p>

<p>Even Don Pablo had heard of its being used by the Indians for this
purpose, and knew it by the name of &ldquo;<i>yesca de hormigas</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;touch-wood
of ants.&rdquo; He had heard, moreover, that it was far superior even
to the ants' nests of Cayenne, which form an article of commerce and
are highly prized in the hospitals of Europe. Guapo, therefore, ran
off and robbed the green ants of their nests, and speedily returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
with the full of his hands of the soft &ldquo;yesca.&rdquo; This was applied to
the wounds, and in a few minutes the bleeding was effectually
stopped, and Leon, although still suffering pain, had now only to be
patient and get well.</p>

<p>Strange to say, another incident occurred that very evening, which
taught our party a further lesson of the danger of taking to the
water without knowing more of its inhabitants. Just as they had
finished supper, and were seated in front of their new house, the
mule, that had been let loose, stepped into the river to drink and
cool its flanks. It was standing in the water, which came up to its
belly, and, having finished its drink, was quietly gazing around it.
All at once, it was observed to give a violent plunge, and make with
hot haste for the bank. It snorted and looked terrified, while its red
nostrils were wide open, and its eyes appeared as if they would start
from their sockets. At length it reached the bank, and, staggering
forward, rolled over in the sand, as if it was going to die!</p>

<p>What could all this mean? Had it, too, been attacked by the
&ldquo;caribes?&rdquo; No; that was not likely, as the bite of these creatures
upon the hard shanks of the mule could not have produced such an
effect. They might have frightened it, but they could not have
thrown it into &ldquo;fits&rdquo;&mdash;for it was evidently in some sort of a fit at
that moment.</p>

<p>It might have been a puzzle to our party not easily solved, had
Guapo not been upon the spot. But Guapo had witnessed such an
incident before. Just before the mule gave the first plunge Guapo's
eyes had been wandering in that direction. He had noticed an odd-looking
form glide near the mule and pass under the animal's belly.
This creature was of a greenish-yellow colour, about five feet in
length, and four or five inches thick. It resembled some kind of
water-snake more than a fish, but Guapo knew it was not a snake,
but an eel. It was the great <i>electric eel</i>&mdash;the &ldquo;temblador,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;gymnotus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This explained the mystery. The gymnotus, having placed itself
under the belly of the unsuspecting mule, was able to bring its body
in contact at all points, and hence the powerful shock that had
created such an effect.</p>

<p>The mule, however, soon recovered, but from that time forward, no
coaxing, nor leading, nor driving, nor whipping, nor pushing, would
induce that same mule to go within twenty feet of the bank of that
same piece of water.</p>

<p>Guapo now bethought himself of the narrow escape he himself had
had while swimming across to the palm-woods; and the appearance
of the gymnotus only rendered him more determined to keep the
promise he had made to Leon,&mdash;that is, that he would revenge him
of the caribes.</p>

<p>None of them could understand how Guapo was to get his revenge
without catching the fish, and that would be difficult to do. Guapo,
however, showed them how on the very next day.</p>

<p>During that evening he had made an excursion into the wood, and
returned home carrying with him a large bundle of roots.</p>

<p>They were the roots of two species of plants&mdash;one of the genus
<i>Piscidea</i>, the other a <i>Jacquinia</i>. Out of these, when properly pounded
together, Guapo intended to make the celebrated &ldquo;barbasco,&rdquo; or fish-poison,
which is used by all the Indians of South America in capturing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
fish. Guapo knew that a sufficient quantity of the barbasco thrown
into the water would kill either &ldquo;temblador,&rdquo; caribe, or any fish that
ever swam with fins.</p>

<p>And so it proved. In the morning Guapo having prepared his
barbasco, proceeded to the upper end of the lake-like opening of the
river, and there flung his poison into the stream. The slow current
through the valley greatly favoured him, and from the large quantity
of roots he had used, the whole pool was soon infected with it. This
was seen from the whitish tinge which the water assumed. The
barbasco had scarcely time to sink to the bottom when small fish
were seen coming to the surface, and turning &ldquo;wrong side uppermost.&rdquo;
Then larger ones appeared, and in a few minutes all the fish in that
particular stretch of water, with several gymnoti, were seen floating
on the surface quite dead. To the great joy of Guapo and Leon, who
sat by the bank watching, hundreds of the little caribes, with their
bronze gills quite open, and their yellow bellies turned up, were seen
among the rest.</p>

<p>But Guapo had not made this great slaughter purely out of revenge.
He had another object. They were not too well off for meat, and a
dish of fish would be welcome. Guapo and Don Pablo had already
provided themselves with long-handled nets, and they soon scooped
out several basketfuls of fish. Among others they netted numerous
&ldquo;caribes,&rdquo; for these little monsters, fierce as they are, are not surpassed
for delicacy of flavour by any fish in the South American
rivers. The gymnoti approached the bank, where Guapo fished them
out, not to eat&mdash;although they are often eaten. There was not a
spark of electricity in them now. The barbasco had cured them of
that; any one might have handled them with safety, as there was not
a charge left in their whole battery.</p>

<p>The lake was quite cleared of all its dangerous denizens, and Leon
might bathe with safety, as soon as he got well; and over the fish-dinner
they could now laugh at the adventures both of Leon and the
electrified mule.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE CINCHONA-TREES.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span>n about two weeks from their arrival in the valley, the house, with
a stable for the horse and mule, was completed, and all the necessary
furniture as well. Had you entered the establishment about this
time, you would have observed many odd articles and implements,
most of them quite new. You would have seen boxes woven out of
palm leaves, and bags made of the fibrous, cloth-like spathe of the
&ldquo;bussu,&rdquo; filled with the soft, silky cotton of the bombax, to be
afterwards spun and woven for shirts and dresses.</p>

<p>You would have seen baskets of various shapes and sizes woven
out of the rind of the leaf-stalks of a singular palm called &ldquo;I&uacute;,&rdquo;
which has no stem, but only leaves of ten feet long, growing directly
out of the ground. You would have seen chairs made of split palms
and bamboo, and a good-sized table, upon which, at meal-time,
might be noticed a table-cloth, not of diaper, but, what served
equally well, the broad smooth silken leaves of the plantain. There
were cups, too, and plates, and bowls, and dishes, and bottles, of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
light gourd-shell (<i>Crescentia cujete</i>), some of the bottles holding
useful liquids, and corked with the elastic pith of a palm. Other
vessels of a boat-shape might be noticed.</p>

<p>There were large wooden vessels pointed at the ends like little
canoes. They were nothing more than the spathes or flower-sheaths
of one of the largest of palms, the &ldquo;<i>Inaga</i>.&rdquo; This noble tree rises to
the height of one hundred feet, and carries feathery fronds of more
than fifty feet in length. The spathes are so large that they are
used by the Indian women for cradles and baskets; and their wood
is so hard, that hunters often cook meat in them, hanging them over
the fire when filled with water!</p>

<p>Many other singular implements might have been noticed in the
new home. One, a cylinder of what appeared to be wood, covered
thickly with spinous points, hung against the wall. That was a
grater, used for the manioc, or yucca roots; and it was a grater of
nature's own making, for it was nothing more than a piece of one of
the air roots of the &ldquo;pashiuba&rdquo; palm, already described. Another
curious object hung near this last. It was a sort of conical bag,
woven out of palm-fibre, with a loop at the bottom, through which
loop a strong pole was passed, that acted as a lever when the article
was in use. This wicker-work bag was the &ldquo;tipiti.&rdquo; Its use was to
compress the grated pulp of the manioc roots, so as to separate the
juice from it, and thus make &ldquo;cassava.&rdquo; The roots of the yucca, or
manioc plant, grow in bunches like potatoes.</p>

<p>Some of them are oblong&mdash;the length of a man's arm&mdash;and more
than twenty pounds in weight. When required for use, the bark is
scraped off, and they are grated down. They are then put into the
tipiti, already mentioned; and the bag is hung up to a strong pin,
while the lever is passed through the loop at the bottom. Its short
end goes under a firm notch, and then some one usually sits upon the
long end until the pulp is squeezed sufficiently dry. The bag is so
formed that its extension, by the force of the lever, causes its sides to
close upon the pulp, and thus press out the juice. The pulp is next
dried in an oven, and becomes the famous &ldquo;cassava&rdquo; or &ldquo;farinha,&rdquo;
which, throughout the greater part of South America, is the only
bread that is used. The juice, of course, runs through the wicker-work
of the <i>tipiti</i> into a vessel below, and there produces a sediment,
which is the well-known &ldquo;tapioca.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are two kinds of the yucca or manioc-root,&mdash;the <i>yucca dulce</i>,
and <i>yucca amarga</i>&mdash;the sweet and bitter. One may be eaten raw
without danger. The other, which very closely resembles it, if eaten
raw, would produce almost instant death, as its juice is one of the
deadliest of vegetable poisons. Even while it is dripping from the
tipiti into the vessel placed below, great care is always taken lest
children or other animals should drink of it.</p>

<p>There were no beds&mdash;such things are hardly to be found in any
part of tropical America&mdash;at least not in the low hot countries. To
sleep in a bed in these climates is far from being pleasant. The
sleeper would be at the mercy of a thousand crawling things,&mdash;insects
and reptiles. Hammocks, or &ldquo;redes,&rdquo; as they are called, take
the place of bedsteads; and five hammocks, of different dimensions,
could be seen about the new house. Some were strung up within, others
in the porch in front, for, in building his house, Don Pablo had
fashioned it so that the roof protruded in front, and formed a shaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
verandah&mdash;a pleasant place in which to enjoy the evenings. Guapo
had made the hammocks, having woven the cords out of the epidermis
of the leaf of a noble palm, called &ldquo;tucum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their home being now sufficiently comfortable, Don Pablo began
to turn his attention to the object for which he had settled on that
spot. He had already examined the cinchona-trees, and saw that
they were of the finest species. They were, in fact, the same which
have since become celebrated as producing the &ldquo;Cuzconin,&rdquo; and
known as <i>Cascarilla de Cuzco</i> (Cuzco bark).</p>

<p>Of the Peruvian-bark trees there are many species,&mdash;between
twenty and thirty. Most of these are true cinchona-trees, but there
are also many kinds of the genus <i>Exostemma</i>, whose bark is collected
as a febrifuge, and passes in commerce under the name of <i>Peruvian
bark</i>. All these are of different qualities and value. Some are
utterly worthless, and, like many other kinds of &ldquo;goods,&rdquo; form a sad
commentary on the honesty of commerce.</p>

<p>The species, which grew on the sides of the adjacent hills, Don
Pablo recognised as one of the most valuable. It was a nearly-allied
species to the tree of Loxa, which produces the best bark. It
was a tall slender tree&mdash;when full grown, rising to the height of
eighty feet; but there were some of every age and size. Its leaves
were five inches long and about half that breadth, of a reddish
colour, and with a glistening surface, which rendered them easily
distinguished from the foliage of the other trees. Now it is a fortunate
circumstance that the Peruvian-bark trees differ from all
others in the colour of their leaves.</p>

<p>Were this not the case, &ldquo;bark-hunting&rdquo; would be a very troublesome
operation. The labour of finding the trees would not be repaid
with double the price obtained for the bark. You may be thinking,
my young friend, that a &ldquo;cascarillero,&rdquo; or bark-hunter, has nothing
to do but find a wood of these trees; and then the trouble of searching
is over, and nothing remains but to go to work and fell them. So it
would be, did the cinchona-trees grow together in large numbers,
but they do not. Only a few&mdash;sometimes only a single tree&mdash;will
be found in one place; and I may here remark that the same is true
of most of the trees of the Great Monta&ntilde;a of South America. This
is a curious fact, because it is a different arrangement from that made
by nature in the forests of North America.</p>

<p>There a whole country will be covered with timber of a single, or
at most two or three species; whereas, in South America, the forests
are composed of an endless variety. Hence it has been found difficult
to establish saw-mills in these forests, as no one timber can be
conveniently furnished in sufficient quantity to make it worth while.
Some of the palms, as the great <i>morichi</i>, form an exception to this
rule. These are found in vast <i>palmares</i>, or palm-woods, extending
over large tracts of country, and monopolising the soil to themselves.</p>

<p>Don Pablo, having spent the whole of a day in examining the
cinchonas, returned home quite satisfied with them, both as regarded
their quantity and value. He saw, from a high tree which he had
climbed, &ldquo;<i>manchas</i>,&rdquo; or spots of the glistening reddish leaves, nearly
an acre in breadth. This was a fortune in itself. Could he only
collect 100,000 lbs. of this bark, and convey it down stream to the
mouth of the Amazon, it would there yield him the handsome sum of
40,000 or 50,000 dollars! How long before he could accomplish this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
task he had not yet calculated; but he resolved to set about it at
once.</p>

<span class="caption">GUAPO AND THE &#39;NIMBLE PETERS.&#39;</span></div>

<p>A large house had been already constructed for storing the bark,
and in the dry hot climate of the high Monta&ntilde;a, where they now
were, Don Pablo knew it could be dried in the woods, where it was
stripped from the trees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<div class="cap">A PAIR OF SLOW GOERS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span>t length, all things being ready, Don Pablo and party set out for
a day's work among the cinchonas. As it was the first day of bark-gathering
all went along to enjoy the novelty of the thing. A
&ldquo;mancha&rdquo; of the cinchona trees was not far off, so their journey
would be a short one. For this reason, the horse and mule remained
in the stable eating the fruits of the &ldquo;murumuru&rdquo; palm, of which
all cattle are exceedingly fond. Even the hard undigested stones or
nuts, after passing through the bodies of horses and cattle, are eagerly
devoured by wild or tame hogs, and the zamuros, or black vultures,
when hungered, take to the pulpy fruit of this thorny palm-tree.</p>

<p>It was a very early hour when they set out, for Don Pablo and his
people were no sluggards. Indeed, in that climate, the early morning
hours are the pleasantest, and they had made it a rule to be always
up at daybreak. They could thus afford to take a <i>siesta</i> in their
hammocks during the hot noontide,&mdash;a custom very common, and
almost necessary, in tropical countries. Their road to the cinchonas
led up the stream, on the same side with the house. After going a few
hundred yards, they entered a grove of trees that had white trunks
and leaves of a light silvery colour. The straight, slender stems of
these trees, and the disposition of their branches,&mdash;leaning over at
the tops,&mdash;gave them somewhat the appearance of palms. They
were not palms, however, but &ldquo;amba&iuml;ba&rdquo; trees. So said Don Pablo,
as they passed under their shade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't wonder,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;if we should see that strange
animal the a&iuml;. The leaves of these trees are its favourite food, and it
lives altogether among their branches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the 'nimble Peter,' do you not, papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This inquiry was put by Leon, who had read about the animal
under this name, and had read many false stories of it, even in the
works of the great Buffon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Don Pablo; &ldquo;it goes by that name sometimes, on
account of its sluggish habits and slow motions. For the same
reason the English call it 'sloth,' and it is known among naturalists
as <i>bradypus</i>. There are two or three species, but all with very
similar habits, though, as usual, the French classifiers have separated
them into distinct genera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Buffon says,&rdquo; rejoined Leon, &ldquo;that it is the most miserable
creature in the world; that it can scarcely get from tree to tree;
that some remain in the same tree all their lives, or, that when one
has eaten all the leaves off a tree, it drops to the ground, to save
itself the trouble of getting down by the trunk, and, that when on
the ground it cannot move a yard in an hour. Is all this true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Totally untrue. It is true the a&iuml; does not move rapidly over the
ground, but the ground is not its proper place no more than it is
that of the orang-otang, or other tree-monkeys. Its conformation
shows that nature intended it for an inhabitant of the trees, where
it can move about with sufficient ease to procure its food. On the
branches it is quite at home, or, rather, I should say, <i>under</i> the
branches, for, unlike the squirrels and monkeys, it travels along the
under sides of the horizontal limbs, with its back downward. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
it can do with ease, by means of its great curving claws, which are
large enough to span the thickest boughs. In this position, with
a long neck of <i>nine vertebr&aelig;</i>,&mdash;the only animal which has that
number,&mdash;it can reach the leaves on all sides of it; and, when not
feeding, this is its natural position of repose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its remaining during its whole life in one tree, or suffering itself to
fall from the branches, are romances of the early Spanish voyagers,
to which M. Buffon gave too much credit. The a&iuml; does not descend
to the ground at all when it can help it, but passes from one tree
to another by means of the outspreading branches. Sometimes,
when these do not meet, it has cunning enough to wait for a windy
day, and then, taking advantage of some branch blown nearer by
the wind, it grasps it and passes to the next tree. As it requires no
drink, and can live without any other food than the leaves of the
<i>cecropia</i>, of course it remains on a single tree so long as it has plenty
of leaves. See!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Pablo, pointing up; &ldquo;here are
several trees stripped of their leaves! I'll warrant that was done by
the a&iuml;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>A-ee</i>!&rdquo; echoed a voice in the most lugubrious tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; cried Don Pablo, laughing at the surprise which
the voice had created among the rest of the party. &ldquo;That's the very
fellow himself,&mdash;this way,&mdash;here he is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of them ran under the tree to which Don Pablo pointed, and
looked up. There, sure enough, was an animal about the size of
a cat, of a dark hay colour, with a patch of dirty orange and black
upon the back. This could be easily seen, for the creature was
hanging along a horizontal branch with its back downward, and its
huge curving claws, all in a bunch, were hooked over the branch.
Its hair was thick and rough, and no tail was visible, but its small
round head and flat face was almost as like the human face as is that
of any monkey. Indeed, the others would have taken it for a
monkey,&mdash;Guapo excepted,&mdash;had they not been already talking about
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yonder's another!&rdquo; cried Leon, pointing higher up in the
tree; and, sure enough, there was, for the a&iuml; is usually found in
company with its mate. The other was a copy of the one already
observed, with some slight difference in size&mdash;no doubt it was the
female one. Both had observed the approach of the party, and now
uttered their melancholy &ldquo;Ayee&mdash;a-ee!&rdquo; that sounded anything but
agreeable. In fact, so very disagreeable is the voice of this creature,
that it has been considered its best weapon of defence. Beside the
utterance of their cry, neither of them made any effort to escape
or defend themselves.</p>

<p>Don Pablo and the rest were about to pass on and leave the a&iuml;s
to their leaf diet, but Guapo had other notions on that subject.
Ugly as these creatures were, Guapo intended to have one of them
for his dinner. He, therefore, begged Don Pablo to stop a moment
until he should get them down. How was this to be done? Would
he climb up and drag them from the tree? That is not so easily
accomplished, for the a&iuml;s, with their crescent claws, can hold on with
terrible force. Besides, they were out upon the slender branches,
where it would have been difficult to get at them.</p>

<p>But Guapo did not intend to climb. The tree was a slender one&mdash;he
had his axe with him&mdash;and the next moment its keen blade was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
crashing through the bark of the amba&iuml;ba wood. A few minutes
served to bring the tree down, and down it came, the a&iuml;s screaming
as it fell. Guapo now approached to seize them, but about this he
used some caution. Both finding themselves without hope of escape,
prepared for defence. Buffon asserts that they make none. That
is not true, as was seen by all the party.</p>

<p>Throwing themselves on their backs, they struck out with their
fore-arms in a sort of mechanical manner. These with the long
horny claws they kept playing in front of their bodies, striking
alternately with them, and rapidly, as a dog will do when suddenly
plunged into water. Guapo did not put his hands near them. He
knew they would not bite, but he also knew that he might get
a scratch with the sharp claws, and that he did not wish for. But
Guapo had a way to take them, and that he now put in practice.
Lopping a couple of branches from the tree, he held one out to each
of the a&iuml;s, and touched them with it on the breast.</p>

<p>Each, as soon as it felt the branch, clutched it tightly between its
powerful fore-arms and held on as if for life and death. It would
have taken a stronger man than Guapo to have pulled either of the
branches away again. The thing was now done. Giving his axe to
Leon to carry for him, Guapo lifted an a&iuml;, still clinging to the
branch, in each hand, and carried them off as if they had been a pair
of water-pots. He did not wish to kill them until he got them
home, alleging that they were better for eating when freshly
butchered.</p>

<p>The bark-hunters now continued their route, and shortly after
entered a little glade or opening in the forest, about an acre in size.
When they had reached the middle of this, Guapo threw his a&iuml;s
upon the ground and marched on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you leave them?&rdquo; inquired the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No fear for them,&rdquo; replied Guapo; &ldquo;they'll be there when we
come back. If I carried them into the woods, they might steal off
while we were at work, but it would take them six hours to get to
the nearest tree.&rdquo; All laughed at this, and went on, leaving the a&iuml;s
to themselves. Before passing out from the glade, they stopped
a moment to look at the great, conical nests of the termites, or
white ants, several of which, like soldiers' tents, stood near the edge
of the glade. It was yet early, the air was chilly, and the ants were
not abroad; so that, after gazing for a while on these singular
habitations, the bark-gatherers pursued their way, and were soon
under the shadow of the cinchona trees.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE BARK-HUNTERS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span>n a few minutes the work began&mdash;that work which was to occupy
them, perhaps, for several years. The first blow of Guapo's axe was
the signal to begin the making of a fortune. It was followed by
many others, until one of the cinchonas lay along the sward. Then
Guapo attacked another, as near the root as was convenient for
chopping.</p>

<p>Don Pablo's part of the work now began. Armed with a sharp
knife, he made circular incisions round the trunk, at the distance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
several feet from each other, and a single longitudinal one intersecting
all the others. The branches were also served in a similar way,
and then the tree was left as it lay. In three or four days they would
return to strip off the bark both from trunk and branches, and this
would be spread out under the sun to dry. When light and dry it
would be carried to the storehouse. So the work went merrily on.
The trees were taken as they stood&mdash;the very young ones alone being
left, as the bark of these is useless for commerce.</p>

<p>The Do&ntilde;a Isidora sat upon a fallen trunk, and, conversing with her
husband, watched the proceedings with interest. A new and happy
future seemed at no great distance off. Little Leona stood beside
Guapo, watching the yellow chips as they flew, and listening to some
very fine stories with which Guapo was regaling her. Guapo loved
little Leona. He would have risked his life for her, would Guapo,
and Leona knew it.</p>

<p>Leon was not particularly engaged on that day. When the bark
was ready for peeling he intended to take a hand with the rest. He
could then employ himself in spreading it, or could lead the mule in
carrying it to the storehouse. Leon did not intend to be idle, but
there happened to be no work for him just then; and after watching
the bark-cutters for awhile, he sauntered back along the path, in
order to have a little fun with the a&iuml;s. Leon had no very great confidence
that he would find them in the place where they had been
left, and yet he believed in Guapo. But it was hard to understand
that two animals, each endowed with a full set of legs and feet, should
not be able to make their way for a distance of twenty paces, and
escape! After the rough handling they had had, too! He would
have a peep at them, anyhow, to see how they were coming on. So
back he went.</p>

<p>On getting near the glade their voices reached him. They were
there, after all! He could hear them utter their pitiful &ldquo;ay-ee&mdash;ay-ee!&rdquo;
and, as he thought, in a louder and more distressing tone
than ever. What could be the matter? They had been silent for
some time, he was sure, for such cries as they now uttered could have
been heard easily where the rest were. What could be the meaning
of this fresh outburst? Had some new enemy attacked them? It
seemed like enough.</p>

<p>Leon stole forward, and peeped into the glade. No&mdash;there was
nothing near them! But what was the matter with the creatures?
Instead of lying quietly, as they had done when left behind, they
were now rolling and tumbling backward and forward, and pitching
about, and dancing first on their feet and then on their heads, and
cutting all sorts of strange capers! Could it be for their own
amusement? No; their lamentable cries precluded that supposition;
besides, their odd attitudes and contortions bespoke terror and
pain!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carrambo!&rdquo; muttered Leon. &ldquo;What's the matter with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They seemed inclined to escape towards the trees; but, after making
a few lengths, they would fall to the ground, tumble about, and
then, getting up again, head in the opposite direction!</p>

<p>Leon was puzzled,&mdash;no wonder. He looked around for a solution
of this queer conduct on the part of the a&iuml;s. No explanation appeared.
At length he bethought himself of going up to them. Perhaps, when
nearer, he might learn what set them a-dancing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he ejaculated, struck with some sudden thought. &ldquo;I know
now; there's a snake at them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This conjecture&mdash;for it was only a conjecture&mdash;caused him to stop
short. It might be some venomous snake, thought he. The grass
was not long, and he could have seen a very large snake; but still a
small coral snake, or the little poisonous viper, might have been there.
He fancied he saw something moving; but to get a better view he
passed slowly around the edge of the glade, until he was nearly on
the opposite side to that where he had entered. He still kept at a
good distance from the a&iuml;s, but as yet discovered no snake.</p>

<p>To his great surprise, the a&iuml;s now lay stretched along the grass,
their struggles appeared each moment to grow less violent, and their
melancholy cries became weaker and weaker. Their contortions at
length came to an end. A feeble effort to raise themselves alone
could be perceived,&mdash;then a spasmodic motion of their long crooked
limbs,&mdash;their cries became indistinct; and, after a while, both lay
motionless and silent! Were they dead? Surely so, thought Leon.</p>

<p>He stood gazing at them for some minutes. Not a motion of their
bodies could be perceived. Surely they had no longer lived! But,
then, what could have killed them? There was no snake to be seen;
no animal of any kind except themselves! Had they been taken with
some sudden disease,&mdash;some kind of convulsions that had ended
fatally? This seemed the most probable thing, judging from the odd
manner in which they had acted. Maybe they had eaten some sort
of plant that had poisoned them!</p>

<p>These conjectures passed rapidly through the mind of Leon. Of
course, he resolved to satisfy himself as to the cause of their death, if
dead they actually were. He began to draw nearer, making his
advances with stealth and caution&mdash;as he was still apprehensive about
the snake.</p>

<p>After he had made a few paces in a forward direction, he began to
perceive something moving around the bodies of the animals. Snakes?
No. What then? A few paces nearer. See! the whole ground is in
motion. The bodies of the a&iuml;s, though dead, are covered with living,
moving objects! Ha! <i>it is a &ldquo;chacu&rdquo; of the white ants</i>.</p>

<p>Leon now comprehended the whole affair. The ground was literally
alive with the terrible <i>termites</i>. They had made their foray, or
&ldquo;chacu,&rdquo; as it is called, from the neighbouring cones; they had
attacked the helpless a&iuml;s, and put them to death, with their poisonous
stings! Already they were tearing them to pieces, and bearing them
off to their dark caves! So thick were they on the bodies of the
animals, that the latter had suddenly changed their colour, and now
appeared to be nothing more than living heaps of crawling insects!</p>

<p>It was a hideous sight to behold, and Leon felt his flesh creep as he
looked upon it. Still he felt a curiosity to witness the result, and he
stood watching the busy crowd that had gathered about the a&iuml;s. He
had heard strange accounts of these white ants; how that, in a few
minutes, they will tear the carcasses of large animals to pieces, and
carry them away to their dens; and he was determined to prove the
truth of this by observation. He did not go any nearer, for he was
not without some dread of these ugly creatures; but, happening to
find himself beside a small tree, with low horizontal branches, he
climbed up, and sat down upon one of the branches, resting his feet
upon another. He was inclined to take the thing as easily as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>His perch commanded a full view of the operations of the termites,
and for a long time he sat watching them with interest. He could
see that it was not the same set that were always on the carcasses of
the a&iuml;s. On the contrary, one host were always leaving the spot,
while another took their places, and from the great conical houses
fresh bands appeared to issue. In fact, two great parallel belts of
them, like army columns, stretched from the &ldquo;hills&rdquo; to the a&iuml;s, going
in opposite directions.</p>

<p>Those which travelled towards the cells presented a very different
appearance to the others. These were loaded with pieces of torn
flesh, or skin with tufts of hair adhering to it; and each ant carried
a piece by far larger than its own body. Their bodies, in fact, were
quite hidden under their disproportionate burdens. The others&mdash;those
which were coming from the conical hills&mdash;were empty-handed,
and presented the appearance of a whittish stream flowing along the
surface of the ground!</p>

<p>It was a most singular sight; and Leon sat watching the creatures
until his head was giddy, and he felt as though the ground itself was
in motion.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE PUMA AND THE GREAT ANT-BEAR.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span>ll at once the attention of the boy was called away from the crawling
millions. A rustling among some dead leaves was heard. It
appeared to proceed from the edge of the glade, not far from the ant-hills.
The branches of the underwood were seen to move, and the
next moment a slender cylindrical object, about a foot and a half in
length, was protruded out from the leaves. Had there not been a
pair of small eyes and ears near the farther end of this cylindrical
object, no one would have taken it for the head and snout of an
animal. But Leon saw the little sparkling black eyes, and he therefore
conjectured that it was some such creature.</p>

<p>The next moment the body came into view, and a singular creature
it was. It was about the size of a very large Newfoundland dog,
though of a different shape. It was covered all over with long brownish
hair, part of which looked so coarse as to resemble dry grass or
bristles. On each shoulder was a wide strip of black, bordered with
whitish bands; and the tail, which was full three feet long, was
clothed with a thick growth of coarse hair, several inches in length,
that looked like strips of whalebone. This was carried aloft, and
curving over the back. But the most curious feature of the animal
was its snout.</p>

<p>Talk of the nose of a grey hound. It would be a &ldquo;pug&rdquo; in comparison!
That of this animal was full twice as long, and not half so
thick, with a little mouth not over an inch in size, and without a
single tooth! It was certainly the oddest snout Leon had ever seen.
The legs, too, were remarkable. They were stout and thick, the
hinder ones appearing much shorter than the fore-legs; but this was
because the creature in its hind-feet was <i>plantigrade</i>, that is, it
walked with the whole of its soles touching the surface, which only
bears and a few other sorts of quadrupeds do.</p>

<p>Its fore-feet, too, were oddly placed upon the ground. They had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
four long claws upon each, but these claws, instead of being spread
out, as in the dog or cat, were all folded backward along the sole, and
the creature, to avoid treading on them, actually walked on the sides
of its feet! The claws were only used for scraping up the ground,
and then it could bring them forward in a perpendicular position,
like the blade of a hoe, or the teeth of a garden-rake. Of course,
with feet furnished in such an out-of-the-way fashion, the animal
moved but slowly over the ground. In fact it went very slowly, and
with a stealthy pace.</p>

<p>Although Leon had never seen the creature before, he had read
about it, and had also seen pictures of it. He knew it, therefore, at
a glance. That proboscis-looking snout was not to be mistaken. It
could belong to no other creature than the <i>tamanoir</i>, or <i>great ant-eater</i>,
by the people of South America called the <i>ant-bear</i>. It was, in fact,
that very thing; but to Leon's astonishment, as soon as it got fairly
out of the bushes, he noticed a singular-looking hunch upon its back,
just over the shoulder. At first he could not make out what this
was, as he had never heard of such a protuberance, besides, the tail
half hid it from his view. All of a sudden the animal turned its head
backwards, touched the hunch with its snout, gave itself a shake,
and then the odd excrescence fell to the ground, and proved to be a
young ant-eater, with bushy tail and long snout, the &ldquo;very image of
its mother.&rdquo; The large one was thus seen to be a female that had
been carrying her infant upon her shoulders.</p>

<p>It was close to one of the ant-hills where the old tamanoir placed
her young upon the ground, and turning away from it, she approached
the great cone. Erecting herself upon her hind-feet, she stood with
the fore ones resting against the hill, apparently examining it, and
considering in what part of it the shell or roof was thinnest and
weakest. These cones, composed of agglutinated sand and earth,
are frequently so stoutly put together that it requires a pick-axe or
crowbar to break them open.</p>

<p>But the ant-eater knew well that her fore-feet were armed with an
implement equal to either pick or crow, and she would certainly
have made a hole there and then, had she not noticed, on looking
around to the other side, that the inhabitants of the hill were all
abroad upon one of their forays. This seemed to bring about a
sudden change in her determination, and, dropping her fore-feet to
the ground, she once more threw up her great tail, and returned to
where she had left her young one. Partly pushing it before her with
her snout, and partly lifting it between her strong fore-arms, she
succeeded in bringing the latter to the border of the path along
which travelled the ants.</p>

<p>Here she squatted down, and placed herself so that the point of
her nose just touched the selvedge of the swarming hosts, having
caused the youngster by her side to do the same. Then throwing out
a long worm-like tongue, which glittered with a viscous coating, she
drew it back again covered with ants. These passed into her mouth,
and thence, of course, into her capacious stomach. The tongue,
which was more than a foot in length, and nearly as thick as a quill,
was again thrown out, and again drawn back, and this operation she
continued, the tongue making about two &ldquo;hauls&rdquo; to every second
of time! Now and then she stopped eating, in order to give
some instructions to the little one that was seen closely imitating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
her, and with its more slender tongue dealing death among the
<i>termites</i>.</p>

<p>So very comic was the sight that Leon could not help laughing at
it, as he sat upon his perch.</p>

<p>An end, however, was put to his merriment, by the sudden appearance
of another animal&mdash;one of a different character. It was a large
cat-like creature, of a reddish-yellow, or tawny colour, long body and
tail, round head, with whiskers, and bright gleaming eyes. Leon
had seen that sort of animal before. He had seen it led in strings
by Indians through the streets of Cuzco, and he at once recognised
it. It was the <i>Puma</i>&mdash;the maneless lion of America.</p>

<p>The specimens which Leon had seen with the Indians had been
rendered tame and harmless. He knew that, but he had also been
told that the animal in its wild state is a savage and dangerous
beast. This is true of the puma in some districts, while in others the
creature is cowardly, and will flee at the sight of man. In all cases,
however, when the puma is brought to bay, it makes a desperate
fight, and both dogs and men have been killed in the attack.</p>

<p>Leon had not been frightened at the tamanoir. Even had it been
a savage creature, he knew it could not climb a tree&mdash;though there
are two smaller species of ant-bears in South America that can&mdash;and
he therefore knew he was quite safe on his perch. But his feelings
were very different when the red body of the puma came in sight.
It could run up the smoothest trunk in the forest with as much ease
and agility as a cat, and there would be no chance of escaping from
it if it felt disposed to attack him. Of this the boy was fully conscious,
and no wonder he was alarmed.</p>

<p>His first thought was to leap down, and make for the cinchona-trees,
where the others were; but the puma had entered the glade
from that side, and it was therefore directly in his way: he would
have run right in its teeth by going toward the cinchona-trees. He
next thought of slipping quietly down, and getting into the woods
behind him. Unfortunately, the tree on which he was stood out in
the glade quite apart from any others, the puma would see him go off,
and, of course, could overtake him in a dozen leaps. These thoughts
passed through the boy's mind in a few seconds of time; and in a few
seconds of time he was convinced that his best course would be to
remain where he was, and keep quiet. Perhaps the puma would not
notice him&mdash;as yet he had not.</p>

<p>No doubt he would have done so, had there been nothing else on
the spot to take off his attention; but just as he came into the open
ground, his eyes fell upon the ant-eaters, where they lay squatted and
licking up the termites. He had entered the glade in a sort of
skulking trot, but the moment he saw the tamanoirs he halted, drew
his body into a crouching attitude, and remained thus for some
moments, while his long tail oscillated from side to side, as that of a
cat when about to spring upon a mouse or a sparrow.</p>

<p>Just at this moment the tamanoir, having turned round to address
some conversation to her young companion, espied him, and sprang
to her feet. She recognised in the puma&mdash;as in others of his race&mdash;a
deadly enemy. With one sweep of her fore-arm she flung the young
one behind her, until it rested against the wall of the ant-hill, and
then, following in all haste, threw herself into an erect attitude in
front of her young, covering it with her body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>She was now standing firm upon her hind-feet&mdash;her back resting
against the mud wall&mdash;but her long snout had entirely disappeared!
That was held close along her breast, and entirely concealed by the
shaggy tail, which for this purpose had been brought up in front.
Her defence rested in her strong fore-arms, which, with the great
claws standing at right angles, were now held out in a threatening
manner. The young one, no doubt aware of some danger, had drawn
itself into its smallest bulk, and was clewed up behind her.</p>

<p>The puma dashed forward, open-mouthed, and began the attack.
He looked as though he would carry everything by the first assault;
but a sharp tear from the tamanoir's claws drew the blood from his
cheek, and although it rendered him more furious, it seemed to
increase his caution. In the two or three successive attempts he kept
prudently out of reach of these terrible weapons. His adversary held
her fore-legs wide open, as though she was desirous of getting the
other to rush between them, that she might clutch him, after the
manner of the bears. This was exactly what she wanted, and in this
consists the chief mode of defence adopted by these animals. The
puma, however, seemed to be up to her trick.</p>

<p>This thrust-and-parry game continued for some minutes, and might
have lasted longer, had it not been for the young tamanoir. This
foolish little creature, who up to that moment was not very sure
what the fuss was all about, had the imprudent curiosity to thrust
out its slender snout. The puma espied it, and making a dart
forward, seized the snout in his great teeth, and jerked the animal
from under. It uttered a low squall, but the next moment its head
was &ldquo;crunched&rdquo; between the muscular jaws of the puma.</p>

<p>The old one now appeared to lose all fear and caution. Her tail
fell down. Her long snout was unsheathed from under its protection,
and she seemed undecided what to do. But she was not allowed
much time to reflect. The puma, seeing the snout, the most vulnerable
part, uncovered, launched himself forward like an arrow, and
caught hold of it in his bristling fangs. Then having dragged his
victim forward, he flung her upon her breast, and mounting rapidly
on her back, proceeded to worry her at his pleasure.</p>

<p>Although Leon pitied the poor tamanoir, yet he dared not interfere,
and would have permitted the puma to finish his work, but at that
moment a sharp pain, which he suddenly felt in his ankle, caused him
to start upon his seat, and utter an involuntary scream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<div class="cap">ATTACK OF THE WHITE ANTS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">L</span>eon looked down to ascertain what had caused him such a sudden
pain. The sight that met his eyes made his blood run cold. The
ground below was alive and moving. A white stratum of ants covered
it on all sides to the distance of several yards. <i>They were ascending
the tree!</i> Nay, more; a string of them had already crawled up; the
trunk was crowded by others coming after; and several were upon
his feet, and legs, and thighs! It was one of these that had stung
him!</p>

<p>The fate of the a&iuml;s&mdash;which he had just witnessed&mdash;and the sight of
the hideous host, caused him again to scream out. At the same time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
he had risen to his feet, and was pulling himself up among the upper
branches. He soon reached the highest; but he had not been a
moment there, when he reflected that it would be no security. The
creatures were crawling upwards as fast as they could come.</p>

<p>His next thought was to descend again, leap from the tree, and
crushing the vermin under his feet, make for the bark-cutters. He
had made up his mind to this course, and was already half-down,
when <i>he remembered the puma</i>! In his alarm at the approach of the
ants he had quite forgotten this enemy, and he now remembered that
it was directly in the way of his intended escape. He turned his eyes
in that direction. It was not there! The ant-bears were still upon
the ground&mdash;the young one dead, and the mother struggling in her
last agonies; but no puma!</p>

<p>The boy began to hope that his cries had frightened him off. His
hope was short-lived; for on glancing around the glade, he now
beheld the fierce brute crouching among the grass, and evidently
coming towards him! What was to be done? Would the puma
attack him in the tree? Surely he would; but what better would he
be on the ground? No better, but worse. At all events he had not
time for much reflection, for before two seconds the fierce puma was
close to the tree. Leon was helpless&mdash;he gave himself up for lost.
He could only cry for help, and he raised his voice to its highest
pitch.</p>

<p>The puma did not spring up the tree at once, as Leon had expected.
On the contrary, it crouched round and round with glaring eyes and
wagging tail, as if calculating the mode of attack. Its lips were red&mdash;stained
with the blood of the ant-eaters&mdash;and this added to the
hideousness of its appearance. But it needed not that, for it was
hideous enough at any time.</p>

<p>Leon kept his eyes upon it, every moment expecting it to spring
up the tree. All at once he saw it give a sudden start, and at the
same instant he heard a hissing noise, as if something passed rapidly
through the air. Ha! something sticking in the body of the puma!
It is an arrow,&mdash;a poisoned arrow! The puma utters a fierce growl&mdash;it
turns upon itself&mdash;the arrow is crushed between its teeth. Another
&ldquo;hist!&rdquo;&mdash;another arrow! Hark! a well-known voice&mdash;well-known
voices&mdash;the voices of Don Pablo and Guapo! See! they burst into
the glade&mdash;Don Pablo with his axe, and Guapo with his unerring
gravat&aacute;na!</p>

<p>The puma turns to flee. He has already reached the border of the
wood; he staggers&mdash;the poison is doing its work. Hurrah! he is
down; but the poison does not kill him, for the axe of Don Pablo is
crashing through his skull. Hurrah! the monster is dead, and Leon
is triumphantly borne off on the shoulders of the faithful Guapo!</p>

<p>Don Pablo dragged the puma away, in order that they might get
his fine skin. The ant-eaters, both of which were now dead, he left
behind, as he saw that the termites were crawling thickly around
them, and had already begun their work of devastation. Strange to
say, as the party returned that way, going to dinner, not a vestige
remained either of the a&iuml;s or the ant-eaters, except a few bones and
some portions of coarse hair. The rest of all these animals had been
cleared off by the ants, and carried into the cells of their hollow cones!</p>

<p>It was, no doubt, the noise of the bark-hunters that had started
the ant-eaters abroad, for these creatures usually prowl only in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
night. The same may have aroused the fierce puma from his lair,
although he is not strictly a nocturnal hunter.</p>

<p>A curious incident occurred as they approached the glade on their
way home. The male tamanoir was roused from his nest among the
dry leaves, and Guapo, instead of running upon him and killing the
creature, warned them all to keep a little back, and he would show
them some fun. Guapo now commenced shaking the leaves, so that
they rattled as if rain was falling upon them. At this the ant-eater
jerked up its broad tail, and appeared to shelter itself as with an
umbrella! Guapo then went towards it, and commenced driving it
before him just as if it had been a sheep or goat, and in this manner
he took it all the way to the house. Of course Guapo took care not
to irritate it; for, when that is done, the ant-eater will either turn
out of his way or stop to defend itself.</p>

<p>The tamanoir is not so defenceless a creature as might at first sight
be imagined by considering his small toothless mouth and slow
motions. His mode of defence is that which has been described, and
which is quite sufficient against the tiger-cat, the ocelot, and all the
smaller species of feline animals. No doubt the old female would
have proved a match for the puma had she not been thrown off her
guard by his seizing upon her young. It is even asserted that the
great ant-bear sometimes hugs the jaguar to death; but this I believe
to be a mistake, as the latter is far too powerful and active to be
thus conquered. Doubtless the resemblance of the jaguar to some of
the smaller spotted cats of these countries, leads to a great many
misconceptions concerning the prowess of the <i>American tiger</i>.</p>

<p>Besides the tamanoir there are two, or perhaps three, other species
of <i>ant-bears</i> in the forests of South America. These, however, are so
different in habits and appearance, that they might properly be
classed as a separate genus of animals. They are <i>tree-climbers</i>, which
the tamanoir is not, spite of his great claws. They pursue the ants
that build their nests upon the high branches, as well as the wasps
and bees; and to befit them for this life, they are furnished with
<i>naked prehensile tails</i>, like the opossums and monkeys. These are
characteristics entirely distinct from those of the <i>Myrmecophaga
jubata</i>, or <i>great</i> ant-eater.</p>

<p>One of these species is the <i>tamandua</i>, called by the Spano-Americans
<i>Osso hormiguero</i> (ant-bear). The tamandua is much less than the
tamanoir, being only three and a half feet in length, while the latter
is over seven. The former is of a stouter build, with neither so long
a snout in proportion, nor such claws. The claws, moreover, are
made for tree-climbing, and are not so much in the way when the
animal walks on the ground. It is, therefore, a more active creature,
and stands better upon its limbs. Its fur is short and silky, but the
tail is nearly naked, and, as already stated, highly prehensile, although
it does not sleep hanging by the tail as some other animals do.</p>

<p>The tamandua is usually of a dull straw-colour, although it varies
in this respect, so that several species have been supposed to exist.
It spends most of its time upon the trees; and in addition to its ant-diet,
it feeds upon wild honey, and bees too, whenever it can catch
them. The female, like the tamanoir, produces only one young at a
birth, and like the other species, carries it upon her back until it is
able to provide for itself. The tamandua has sometimes been called
<i>tridactyla</i>, or the &ldquo;three-toed ant-eater,&rdquo; because it has only three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
claws upon each of its fore-feet, whereas the tamanoir is provided
with four.</p>

<p>Another species of &ldquo;ant-bear,&rdquo; differing from both in size and in
many of its habits, is the &ldquo;little ant-eater.&rdquo; This one has only two
claws on each fore-foot, hence its specific name. It is a very small
creature&mdash;not larger than the common grey squirrel&mdash;with a prehensile
tail like the tamandua. The tail, however, is not entirely
naked&mdash;only on the under side near the point. It is not so good a
walker as the three-toed kind, though more active on its feet than the
tamanoir. Standing upon its hind-feet, and supporting itself also by
the tail&mdash;which it has already thrown around some branch&mdash;the little
ant-eater uses its fore-feet as hands to carry food to its mouth. It
lives among the trees, and feeds upon wasps, bees, and especially the
larv&aelig; of both; but it does not use the tongue to any great extent.
It is, on this account, an essentially different sort of animal.</p>

<p>The little ant-eater is usually of a bright yellow colour, brownish
on the back; but there are many varieties in this respect, and some
are of a snowy whiteness. Its fur is soft and silky, sometimes slightly
curled or matted at the points, and the tail fur is annulated, or
ringed, with the prevailing colours of the body.</p>

<p>So much for the ant-bears of America.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE ANT-LION.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span>nts are disagreeable insects in any country, but especially so in
warm tropical climates. Their ugly appearance, their destructive
habits, but, above all, the pain of their sting, or rather bite&mdash;for ants
do not sting as wasps, but bite with the jaws, and then infuse poison
into the wound&mdash;all these render them very unpopular creatures. A
superficial thinker would suppose that such troublesome insects could
be of no use, and would question the propriety of Nature in having
created them.</p>

<p>But when we give the subject a little attention, we find that they
were not created in vain. Were it not for these busy creatures,
what would become of the vast quantities of decomposing substances
found in some countries? What would be done with the decaying
vegetation and the dead animal matter? Why, in many places, were
it not consumed by these insects, and reorganised into new forms of
life, it would produce pestilence and death; and surely these are far
more disagreeable things than ants.</p>

<p>Of ants there are many different kinds; but the greatest number
of species belong to warm countries, where, indeed, they are most
useful. Some of these species are so curious in their habits, that
whole volumes have been written about them, and naturalists have
spent a life-time in their study and observation. Their social and
domestic economy is of the most singular character, more so than
that of the bees; and I am afraid here to give a single trait of their
lives, lest I should be led on to talk too much about them. I need
only mention the wonderful nests or hills which some species build&mdash;those
great cones of twenty feet in height, and so strong that wild
bulls run up their sides and stand upon their tops without doing
them the least injury!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>Others make their houses of cylindrical form, rising several feet
from the surface. Others, again, prefer nesting in the trees, where
they construct large cellular masses of many shapes, suspending them
from the highest branches; while many species make their waxen
dwellings in hollow trunks, or beneath the surface of the earth.
There is not a species, however, whose habits, fully observed and described,
would not strike you with astonishment. Indeed, it is difficult
to believe all that is related about these insects by naturalists
who have made them their study. One can hardly understand how
such little creatures can be gifted with so much intelligence, or
<i>instinct</i>, as some choose to call it.</p>

<p>Man is not the only enemy of the ants. If he were so, it is to be
feared that these small insignificant creatures would soon make the
earth too hot for him. So prolific are they, that if left to themselves
our whole planet would, in a short period, become a gigantic ants'
nest!</p>

<p>Nature has wisely provided against the over increase of the ant
family. No living thing has a greater variety of enemies than they.
In all the divisions of animated nature there are ant-destroyers&mdash;<i>ant-eaters</i>!
To begin with the mammalia, man himself feeds upon
them&mdash;for there are tribes of Indians in South America, the principal
part of whose food consists of dried termites, which they bake into a
kind of &ldquo;paste!&rdquo; There are quadrupeds that live exclusively on
them, as the ant-bear, already described, and the <i>pangolins</i>, or scaly
ant-eaters of the Eastern continent. There are birds, too, of many
sorts that devour the ants; and there are even some who make them
exclusively their food, as the genus <i>Myothera</i>, or &ldquo;ant-catchers.&rdquo;
Many kinds of reptiles, both snakes and lizards, are ant-eaters; and,
what is strangest of all, there are <i>insects</i> that prey upon them!</p>

<p>No wonder, then, with such a variety of enemies that the ants are
kept within proper limits, and are not allowed to overrun the earth.</p>

<p>The observations just made are very similar to those that were
addressed by Do&ntilde;a Isidora to the little Leona, one day when they
were left alone. The others had gone about their usual occupation of
bark-cutting, and these, of course, remained at home to take care of
the house and cook the dinner. That was already hanging over a
fire outside the house: for in these hot countries it is often more
convenient to do the cooking out-of-doors.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Isidora, busy with some sewing, was seated under the shadow
of the banana-trees, and the pretty little Leona was playing near her.
Leona had been abusing the ants, partly on account of their having
so frightened Leon, and partly because one of the red species had
bitten herself the day before; and it was for this reason that her
mother had entered into such explanations regarding these creatures,
with a view of exculpating them from the bitter accusations urged
against them by Leona. Talking about ants very naturally led them
to cast their eyes to the ground to see if any of the creatures were
near; and sure enough there were several of the red ones wandering
about. Just then the eyes of Do&ntilde;a Isidora rested upon a very different
insect, and she drew the attention of her daughter to it.</p>

<p>It was an insect of considerable size, being full an inch in length,
with an elongated oval body, and a small flat head. From the head
protruded two great horny jaws, that bore some resemblance to a
pair of calliper compasses. Its legs were short and very unfitted for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
motion. Indeed they were not of much use for that purpose, as it
could make very little way on them, but crawled only sidewards, or
backwards, with great apparent difficulty. The creature was of a
greyish or sand colour; and in the sand, where it was seated, it
might not have been observed at all had not the lady's eyes been
directed upon the very spot. But Do&ntilde;a Isidora, who was a very
good entomologist, recognised it; and, knowing that it was a very
curious insect, on this account called the attention of her daughter to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, mamma?&rdquo; inquired the little Leona, bending forward
to examine it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>ant-lion</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ant-lion! Why, mamma, it is an insect! How then can it
be called lion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a name given it,&rdquo; replied the lady, &ldquo;on account of its fierce
habits, which, in that respect, assimilate it to its powerful namesake,&mdash;the
king of the beasts; and, indeed, this little creature has
more strength and ferocity in proportion to its size than even the
lion himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why the <i>ant</i>-lion, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it preys principally on ants. I have said there are insect
ant-eaters. This is one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can such a slow creature as that get hold of them?
Why, the ants could crawl out of its way in a moment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true. Nevertheless it manages to capture as many as it
requires. Remember 'the race is not always to the swift.' It is by
stratagem it succeeds in taking its prey&mdash;a very singular stratagem
too. If you will sit back and not frighten it, I have no doubt it will
soon give you an opportunity of seeing how it manages the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leona took a seat by the side of her mother. They were both at
just such a distance from the ant-lion that they could observe every
movement it made; but for a considerable time it remained quiet;
no doubt, because they had alarmed it. In the interval Do&ntilde;a Isidora
imparted to her daughter some further information about its natural
history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ant-lion,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is not an insect in its perfect state, but
only the <i>larva</i> of one. The perfect insect is a very different creature,
having wings and longer legs. It is one of the <i>neuropterous</i> tribe, or
those with nerved wings. The wings of this species rest against
each other, forming a covering over its body, like the roof upon
a house. They are most beautifully reticulated like the finest lace-work,
and variegated with dark spots, that give the insect a very
elegant appearance. Its habits are quite different to those which it
follows when a larva, or in that state when it is the ant-lion. It
flies but little during the day, and is usually found quietly sitting
amongst the leaves of plants, and seems to be one of the most pacific
and harmless of insects. How very different with the larva&mdash;the
very reverse&mdash;See!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Isidora pointed to the ant-lion that was just then beginning
to bestir itself, and both sat silent regarding it attentively.</p>

<p>First, then, the little creature going backwards, and working with
its callipers, traced a circle on the surface of the sand. This circle
was between two and three inches in diameter. Having completed
it, it now commenced to clear out all the sand within the circle.
To accomplish this, it was seen to scrape up the sand with one of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
fore-feet, and shovel a quantity of it upon its flat head; then, giving
a sudden jerk of the neck, it pitched the sand several inches outside
the traced circumference.</p>

<p>This operation it repeated so often, and so adroitly, that in a very
short time a round pit began to show itself in the surface of the
ground. Whenever it encountered a stone, this was raised between
its callipers and pitched out beyond the ring. Sometimes stones
occurred that were too large to be thrown out in this way. These it
managed to get upon its back, and, then crawling cautiously up the
sides of the pit, it tumbled them upon the edge and rolled them
away. Had it met with a stone so large as to render this impossible,
it would have left the place, and chosen another spot of ground.
Fortunately this was not the case, and they had an opportunity of
watching the labour to its conclusion.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour they sat watching it&mdash;of course not neglecting
their other affairs&mdash;and, at the end of that time, the ant-lion had
jerked out so much sand, that a little funnel-shaped pit was formed
nearly as deep as it was wide. This was its trap, and it was now
finished and ready for action.</p>

<p>Having made all its arrangements, it had nothing more to do than
remain at the bottom of the pit, and wait patiently until some
unfortunate ant should chance to come that way and fall in; and
where these insects were constantly wandering over the ground,
such an accident would, sooner or later, be certain to take place.</p>

<p>Lest the ant should peep into the pit, discover its hideous form
below, and then retreat, this ant-lion had actually the cunning to
bury its body in the sand, leaving only a small portion of its head
to be seen.</p>

<p>Both Do&ntilde;a Isidora and the little Leona remained watching with
increased interest. They were very anxious to witness the result.
They were not kept long in suspense. I have already stated that
many ants were crawling about. There were dozens of them
&ldquo;quatering&rdquo; the ground in every direction in search of their own
prey; and they left not an inch of it unsearched. At last one was
seen to approach the trap of the ant-lion. Curiosity brings it to
the very edge of that terrible pit-fall. It protrudes its head and
part of its body over the brink&mdash;it is not such a terrible gulf to look
into&mdash;if it should slip down, it could easily crawl out again.</p>

<p>Ha! it little knows the enemy that is ambushed there. It
perceives something singular&mdash;an odd something&mdash;perhaps it might
be something good to eat. It is half resolved to slide down and
make a closer examination of this something. It is balancing on the
brink, and would, no doubt, have gone down voluntarily, but that is
no longer left to its own choice. The mysterious object at the
bottom of the funnel suddenly springs up and shows itself&mdash;it is the
ant-lion in all its hideous proportions; and before the little ant can
draw itself away, the other has flung around it a shower of sand
that brings it rolling down the side of the pit. Then the sharp
callipers are closed upon the victim&mdash;all the moisture in his body
is sucked out&mdash;and his remains, now a dry and shapeless mass, are
rested for a moment upon the head of the destroyer, and then jerked
far outside the pit!</p>

<p>The ant-lion now dresses his trap, and, again burying himself in
the sand, awaits another victim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE TATOU-POYOU AND THE DEER CARCASS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">D</span>o&ntilde;a Isidora and Leona had watched all the man&#339;uvres of the
ant-lion with great interest, and Leona, after the bite she had had,
was not in any mood to sympathise with the ants. Indeed, she felt
rather grateful to the ant-lion, ugly as he was, for killing them.</p>

<p>Presently Leon returned from the woods, and was shown the trap
in full operation; but Leon, upon this day, was full of adventures
that had occurred upon the hills to himself, Guapo, and Don Pablo.
In fact, he had hastened home before the others to tell his mamma of
the odd incidents to which he had been a witness.</p>

<p>That morning they had discovered a new <i>mancha</i> of cinchona
trees. When proceeding towards them they came upon the dead
carcass of a deer. It was a large species, the <i>Cervus antisensis</i>, but,
as it had evidently been dead several days, it was swollen out to
twice its original size, as is always the case with carcasses of animals
left exposed in a warm climate. It was odd that some preying
animals had not eaten it up. A clump of tall trees, that shaded it,
had, no doubt, concealed it from the sharp sight of the vultures, and
these birds, contrary to what has so often been alleged, can find
no dead body by the smell. Neither ants nor animals that prey
upon carrion had chanced to come that way, and there lay the deer
intact.</p>

<p>So thought Don Pablo and Leon. Guapo, however, was of a
different opinion, and, going up to the body, he struck it a blow
with his axe. To the surprise of the others, instead of the dead
sound which they expected to hear, a dry crash followed the blow,
and a dark hole appeared where a piece of thin shell-like substance
had fallen off. Another blow from Guapo's axe, and the whole side
went in. Not a bit of carcass was there; there were bones&mdash;clean
bones&mdash;and dry hard skin, but no flesh, not an atom of flesh!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tatou-poyou!&rdquo; quietly remarked Guapo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Don Pablo, &ldquo;an armadillo, you think?&rdquo; recognising,
in Guapo's words, the Indian name for one of the large species of
armadillos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Guapo. &ldquo;All eaten by the tatou-poyou. See!
there's his hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don Pablo and Leon bent over the sham carcass, and, sure enough,
under where its body had been they could see a large hole in the
ground. Outside the carcass, also, at the distance of several feet
was another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is where he entered,&rdquo; said Guapo, pointing to the second.
&ldquo;He's not about here now,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;no, no,&mdash;ate all the meat,
and gone long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was evident, as the hollow skeleton was quite dry, and had
evidently been empty for a good while.</p>

<p>Don Pablo was pleased at this incident, as it gave him an
opportunity of verifying a curious habit of the armadillos. These
creatures are among the finest burrowers in the world, and can bury
themselves in the earth in a few seconds time; but, being badly
toothed,&mdash;some of them altogether without teeth,&mdash;they can only
feed upon very soft substances. Putrid flesh is with them a favourite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
&ldquo;dish,&rdquo; and in order to get at the softest side of a carcass, they
burrow under, and enter it from below, rarely leaving their horrid
cave until they have thoroughly cleared it out.</p>

<p>The bark-hunters now passed on, Don Pablo making many inquiries
about the armadillos, and Guapo giving replies, while Leon listened
with interest. Guapo knew a good deal about these curious creatures,
for he had eaten many a dozen of them in his time, and as many
different kinds of them too. Their feeding upon carrion had no effect
on Guapo's stomach, and, indeed, white people in South America
relish them as much as Indians. The white people, however, make a
distinction in the species, as they suppose some kinds to be more
disposed to a vegetable diet than others.</p>

<p>There are some in the neighbourhood of the settlements, that
<i>occasionally pay a visit to the graveyards or cemeteries</i>, and these kinds
do not go down well. All of them will devour almost any sort of
trash that is soft and pulpy, and they are more destructive to the ant
than even the ant-eaters themselves. How so? Because, instead of
making a nice little hole in the side of the ant-hill, as the tamanoirs
do, and through this hole eating the ants themselves, the armadillos
break down a large part of the structure and devour the <i>larv&aelig;</i>. Now
the ants love these <i>larv&aelig;</i> more than their own lives, and when these
are destroyed, they yield themselves up to despair, refuse to patch up
the building, the rain gets in, and the colony is ruined and breaks up.</p>

<p>It does not follow, however, that the flesh of the armadillo should
be &ldquo;queer&rdquo; because the animal itself eats queer substances. Among
carnivorous creatures the very opposite is sometimes the truth; and
some animals&mdash;as the tapir, for instance&mdash;that feed exclusively on
sweet and succulent vegetables, produce a most bitter flesh for themselves.
About this there is no standing law either way.</p>

<p>The flesh of the armadillo is excellent eating, not unlike young
pork, and, when &ldquo;roasted in the shell&rdquo; (the Indian mode of cooking
it), it is quite equal, if not superior, to a baked &ldquo;pig,&rdquo; a dish very
much eaten in our own country.</p>

<p>Guapo did not call them armadillos&mdash;he had several Indian names
for different kinds of them. &ldquo;Armadillo&rdquo; is the Spanish name, and
signifies the &ldquo;little armed one,&rdquo; the diminutive of &ldquo;armado&rdquo; or
&ldquo;armed.&rdquo; This name is peculiarly appropriate to these animals, as
the hard bony casing which covers the whole upper parts of their
bodies, bears an exceeding resemblance to the suits of plate armour
worn in the days of Cortez and chivalry.</p>

<p>On the head there is the helmet, the back is shielded by a corslet,
and even the limbs are covered with greaves. Of course, this armour
is arranged differently in the different species, and there is more or
less hair upon all, between the joinings of the plates.</p>

<p>These points were not touched upon by Guapo, but others of equal
interest were. He went on to say that he knew many different kinds
of them;&mdash;some not bigger than a rat, and some as large as a full-grown
sheep; some that were slow in their paces, and others that
could outrun a man; some that were flat, and could squat so close as
hardly to be seen against the ground,&mdash;(these were <i>tatou-poyous</i>, the
sort that had hollowed out the deer); and some again that were high-backed
and nearly globe-shaped. Such was Guapo's account of these
curious animals which are found only in the warmer regions of North
and South America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<div class="cap">AN ARMADILLO HUNT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">C</span>onversing in this way, the bark-hunters, at length, reached the
cinchona-trees, and then all talk about armadillos was at an end.
They went lustily to their work&mdash;which was of more importance&mdash;and,
under Guapo's axe, several of the cinchonas soon &ldquo;bit the dust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a spot of open ground just a little to one side of where
these trees stood. They had noticed, on coming up, a flock of zamuros,
or black vultures, out upon this ground, clustered around some object.
It was the carcass of another deer. The first blow of the axe startled
the birds, and they flapped a short way off. They soon returned,
however, not being shy birds, but the contrary.</p>

<p>There was nothing in all this to create surprise, except, perhaps,
the dead deer. What had been killing these animals? Not a beast
of prey, for that would have devoured them, unless, indeed, it might
be the puma, that often kills more than he can eat.</p>

<p>The thought had occurred to Don Pablo that they might have died
from the poisoned arrows of an Indian. This thought somewhat
disquieted him, for he knew not what kind of Indians they might be,&mdash;they
might be friendly or hostile;&mdash;if the latter, not only would all
his plans be frustrated, but the lives of himself and party would be
in danger. Guapo could not assure him on this head; he had been
so long absent from the Great Monta&ntilde;a that he was ignorant of the
places where the tribes of these parts might now be located. These
tribes often change their homes.</p>

<p>He knew that the Chunchos sometimes roamed so far up, and they
were the most dangerous of all the Indians of the Monta&ntilde;a,&mdash;haters
of the whites, fierce and revengeful. It was they who several times
destroyed the settlements and mission stations. If Chunchos were in
the woods they might look out for trouble. Guapo did not think
there were any Indians near. He would have seen some traces of
them before now, and he had observed none since their arrival. This
assurance of the knowing Indian quite restored Don Pablo's confidence,
and they talked no longer on the subject. After a while,
their attention was again called to the vultures. These filthy creatures
had returned to the deer, and were busily gorging themselves, when,
all at once, they were seen to rise up as if affrighted. They did not
fly far,&mdash;only a few feet,&mdash;and stood with outstretched necks looking
towards the carrion, as if whatever had frightened them was there.</p>

<p>The bark-hunters could perceive nothing. It was the body of a
small deer, already half eaten, and no object bigger than a man's
hand could have been concealed behind it. The zamuros, however,
<i>had</i> seen something strange&mdash;else they would hardly have acted as
they did&mdash;and, with this conviction, the bark-hunters stopped their
work to observe them.</p>

<p>After a while the birds seemed to take fresh courage, hopped back
to the carrion, and recommenced tearing at it. In another moment
they again started and flew back, but, this time, not so far as before,
and then they all returned again, and, after feeding another short
while, started back a third time.</p>

<p>This was all very mysterious, but Guapo, guessing what was the
matter, solved the mystery by crying out,&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tatou-poyou</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; inquired Don Pablo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yonder, master, yonder in the body of the beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don Pablo looked, and, sure enough, he could see something moving;
it was the head and shoulders of an armadillo. It had burrowed
and come up through the body of the deer, thus meeting the vultures
half-way! No doubt, it was the mysterious mode by which it had
entered on the stage that had frightened them.</p>

<p>They soon, however, got over their affright, and returned to their
repast.</p>

<p>The armadillo&mdash;a very large one&mdash;had, by this time, crept out into
the open air, and went on eating.</p>

<p>For a while the zamuros took no heed of him, deeming, perhaps,
that, although he had come in by the back-door, he might have as
good a right upon the premises as themselves. Their pacific attitude,
however, was but of short duration; something occurred to ruffle their
temper&mdash;some silent affront, no doubt, for the bark-hunters heard
nothing. Perhaps the <i>tatou</i> had run against the legs of one, and
scraped it with the sharp edge of his corslet. Whether this was the
cause or no, a scuffle commenced, and the beast in armour was attacked
by all the vultures at once.</p>

<p>Of course he did not attack in turn, he had no means; he acted
altogether on the defensive; and this he was enabled to do by simply
drawing in his legs and flattening himself upon the ground. He was
then proof, not only against the beaks and weak talons of a vulture,
but he might have defied the royal eagle himself.</p>

<p>After flapping him with their wings, and pecking him with their
filthy beaks, and clawing him with their talons, the zamuros saw it
was all to no purpose, and desisted. If they could not damage him,
however, they could prevent him from eating any more of the deer;
for the moment he stretched out his neck, several vultures sprang at
him afresh, and would have wounded him in the tender parts of his
throat had he not quickly drawn in his head again. Seeing that his
feast was at an end&mdash;at least above ground&mdash;he suddenly raised his
hind-quarters, and in a brace of seconds buried himself in the earth.
The vultures pecked him behind as he disappeared, but the odd
manner of his exit, like that of his <i>entr&eacute;e</i>, seemed to mystify them,
and several of them stood for some moments in neck-stretched
wonder.</p>

<p>This scene had scarcely ended when a pair of fresh armadillos were
espied, coming from the farther edge of the opening, and, in fact,
from the edge of a precipice, for the river flowed close by, and its
channel was at that point shut in by cliffs. These two were large
fellows, and were making speedily towards the carrion, in order to
get up before it was all gone. Guapo could stand it no longer.
Guapo had tasted roast armadillo, and longed for more. In an
instant, therefore, axe in hand, he was off to intercept the new-comers.
Don Pablo and Leon followed to see the sport and assist in
the capture.</p>

<p>The armadillos, although not afraid of the vultures, seeing the
hunters approach, turned tail and made for the precipice. Guapo
took after one, while Don Pablo and Leon pursued the other. Guapo
soon overhauled his one, but, before he could lay his hands upon it,
it had already half buried itself in the dry ground. Guapo, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
seized the tail and held on; and, although not able to drag it out, he
was resolved it should get no deeper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus-250.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="THE ESCAPE OF THE ARMADILLO." title="THE ESCAPE OF THE ARMADILLO." />
<span class="caption">THE ESCAPE OF THE ARMADILLO.</span></div>

<p>The one pursued by Don Pablo had got close to the edge of the
precipice, before either he or Leon could come up with it. There it
stood for a moment, as if in doubt what plan to pursue. Don Pablo
and Leon were congratulating themselves that they had fairly
&ldquo;cornered&rdquo; it, for the cliff was a clear fall of fifty feet, and, of course,
it could get no farther in that direction, while they approached it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
from two sides so as to cut off its retreat. They approached it with
caution, as they were now near the edge, and it would not do to
move too rashly. Both were bent forward with their arms outstretched
to clutch their prey; they felt confident it was already in
their grasp. Judge their astonishment, then, at seeing the creature
suddenly clew itself into a round ball, and roll over the cliff!</p>

<p>They looked below. They saw it upon the ground; they saw it
open out again, apparently unharmed, for, the next moment, it
scuttled off and hid itself among the rocks by the edge of the water!</p>

<p>They turned toward Guapo, who was still holding his one by the
tail, and calling for help. Although it was but half buried, all three
of them could not have dragged it forth by the tail. That member
would have pulled out before the animal could have been dislodged;
and such is not an unfrequent occurrence to the hunters of the armadillo.
Don Pablo, however, took hold of the tail and held fast until
Guapo loosened the earth with his axe, and then the creature was
more easily &ldquo;extracted.&rdquo; A blow on its head from Guapo made all
right, and it was afterwards carried safely to the house, and &ldquo;roasted
in the shell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was a great day among the &ldquo;armadillos.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE OCELOT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">D</span>uring the whole summer, Don Pablo, Guapo, and Leon, continued
bark-gathering. Every day they went out into the woods, excepting
Sunday of course. That was kept as a day of rest; for, although far
from civilised society, there was not the less necessity for their being
Christians. God dwells in the wilderness as well as in the walled
city, and worship to Him is as pleasing under the shadow of the
forest leaves, as with sounding organ beneath the vaulted dome of
the grand cathedral.</p>

<p>During week-days, while the others were abroad, Do&ntilde;a Isidora and
the little Leona were not idle at home; yet their whole time was
not taken up by the mere concerns of the <i>cuisine</i>. They had an
industry of their own, and, in fact, one that promised to be almost as
profitable in its results as the bark-gathering. This was neither more
nor less than preparing <i>vanilla</i>.</p>

<p>Some days after arriving in the valley, while exploring a wood that
lay at the back of the cultivated ground, Don Pablo discovered that
every tree carried a creeper or parasite of a peculiar kind. It was a
small creeper not unlike ivy, and was covered with flowers of a
greenish-yellow colour, mixed with white. Don Pablo at once recognised
in this parasitical plant one of the many species of lianas
that produce the delicious and perfumed vanilla. It was, in fact, the
finest of the kind&mdash;that which, among the French, is called <i>leq</i>
vanilla; and, from the fact that every tree had a number of these
parasites, and no other climbing vines, Don Pablo came to the conclusion
that they had been planted by the missionaries. It is thus
that vanilla is usually cultivated, by being set in slips at the root of
some tree which may afterwards sustain it.</p>

<p>In the course of the summer, these vanilla vines exhibited a different
appearance. Instead of flowers, long bean-like capsules made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
their appearance. These capsules or pods were nearly a foot in
length, though not much thicker than a swan's quill. They were a
little flattish, wrinkled, and of a yellow colour, and contained inside,
instead of beans, a pulpy substance, surrounding a vast quantity of
small seeds, like grains of sand. These seeds are the perfumed vanilla
so much prized, and which often yield the enormous price of fifty
dollars a pound! To preserve these, therefore, was the work of Do&ntilde;a
Isidora and Leona; and they understood perfectly how to do it.</p>

<p>First, they gathered the pods before they were quite ripe. These
they strung upon a thread, taking care to pass the thread through
that end nearest the footstalk. The whole were next plunged for
an instant into boiling water, which gave them a blanched appearance.
The thread was then stretched from tree to tree, and the pods,
hanging like a string of candles, were then exposed to the sun for
several hours. Next day, they were lightly smeared with an oiled
feather, and then wrapped in oiled cotton of the <i>Bombax ceiba</i>, to
prevent the valves from opening.</p>

<p>When they had remained in this state for a few days, the string
was taken out, and passed through the other ends, so that they
should hang in an inverted position. This was to permit the discharge
of a viscid liquid from the footstalk end; and in order to
assist this discharge, the pods were several times lightly pressed
between the fingers. They now became dry and wrinkled. They
had also shrunk to less than half their original size, and changed
their colour to a reddish-brown. Another delicate touch of the oil-feather,
and the vanilla was ready for the market. Nothing remained
but to pack them in small cases, which had already been prepared
from the leaf of a species of palm-tree.</p>

<p>In such a way did the lady Isidora and her daughter pass their
time; and before the summer was out they had added largely to the
stock of wealth of our exiles.</p>

<p>Although these two always remained by the house, they were not
without <i>their</i> adventures as well, one of which I shall describe. It
occurred while they were getting in their crop of vanilla. Leona
was in the porch in front, busy among the vanilla-beans. She had a
large needle and a thread of palm-leaf fibre, with which she was
stringing the long pods, while her mother was inside the house
packing some that had been already dried.</p>

<p>Leona rested for a moment, and was looking over the water, when,
all at once, she exclaimed,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maman&mdash;Maman! come out and see! oh! what a beautiful cat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exclamation caused Do&ntilde;a Isidora to start, and with a feeling
of uneasiness. The cause of her uneasiness was the word &ldquo;cat.&rdquo; She
feared that what the innocent child had taken for a &ldquo;beautiful cat&rdquo;
might prove to be the dreaded jaguar. She ran at once out of the
door, and looked in the direction pointed out by Leona. There, sure
enough, on the other side of the water, was a spotted creature, looking
in the distance, very much like a cat; but Do&ntilde;a Isidora saw at a
glance that it was a far larger animal.</p>

<p>Was it the jaguar? It was like one, in its colour and markings.
It was of a yellowish colour, and covered all over with black spots,
which gave it the semblance of the jaguar. Still Do&ntilde;a Isidora
thought that it was not so large as these animals usually are; and
this, to some extent, restored her confidence. When first seen, it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
close down to the water's edge, as if it had come there to drink; and
Do&ntilde;a Isidora was in hopes that, after satisfying its thirst, it would
go away again. What was her consternation to see it make a forward
spring, and, plunging into the water, swim directly for the
house!</p>

<p>Terrified, she seized Leona by the hand, and retreated inside. She
shut the door, and bolted it. If it were a jaguar, what protection
would that be? Such a creature could dash itself through the frail
bamboo wall, or tear the door to pieces with his great claws in a
moment. &ldquo;If it be a jaguar,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;we are lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Isidora was a woman of courage. She was determined to
defend the lives of herself and daughter to the last. She looked
around the house for a weapon. The pistols of Don Pablo were
hanging against the wall. She knew they were loaded. She took
them down, and looked to the flints and priming, and then stationed
herself at a place where she could see out through the interstices of
the bamboos. The little Leona kept by her side, though she knew,
that in a struggle with a ferocious jaguar, she could give no help.</p>

<p>By this time the animal had crossed the river, and she could see it
spring out on the bank, and come on towards the house. In a few
seconds it was close to the porch, where it halted to reconnoitre.
Do&ntilde;a Isidora saw it very plainly, and would now have had a very
good chance to fire at it; but she did not wish to begin the combat.
Perhaps it might go away again, without attempting to enter the
house. In order not to draw its attention, she stood perfectly quiet,
having cautioned Leona to do the same.</p>

<p>It was not a large animal, though its aspect was fierce enough to
terrify any one. Its tiger-like eyes, and white teeth, which it showed
at intervals, were anything but pleasant to look upon. Its size, however,
was not so formidable; and Do&ntilde;a Isidora had understood the
jaguar to be a large animal; but there is also a smaller species of
jaguar. This might be the one.</p>

<p>After halting a moment, the creature turned to one side, and then
proceeded at a skulking trot around the house. Now and then it
stopped and looked toward the building, as if searching for some
aperture by which it might get in. Do&ntilde;a Isidora followed it round
on the inside. The walls were so open that she could mark all its
movements; and, with a pistol in each hand, she was ready for the
attack, determined to fire the moment it might threaten to spring
against the bamboos.</p>

<p>On one side of the house, at a few paces distance, stood the mule.
The horse had been taken to the woods, and the mule was left alone.
This animal was tied to a tree, which shaded her from the sun. As
soon as the fierce creature got well round the house, it came in full
view of the mule, which now claimed its attention. The latter, on
seeing it, had started, and sprung round upon her halter, as if badly
terrified by the apparition.</p>

<p>Whether the beast of prey had ever before seen a mule was a question.
Most likely it had not; for, half-innocently, and half as if with
the intention of making an attack, it went skulking up until it was
close to the heels of the latter. It could not have placed itself in a
better position to be well kicked; and well kicked it was, for, just
at that moment, the mule let fling with both her heels, and struck it
upon the ribs. A loud &ldquo;thump&rdquo; was heard by those within the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
house, and Do&ntilde;a Isidora, still watching through the canes, had the
satisfaction to see the spotted creature take to its heels, and gallop
off as if a kettle had been tied to its tail! It made no stop, not even
to look back; but having reached the edge of the water, plunged in,
and swam over to the opposite shore. They could see it climb out on
the other side, and then, with a cowed and conquered look, it trotted
off, and disappeared among the palm-trees.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Isidora knew that it was gone for good; and having now no
further fear went on with her work as before. She first, however,
carried out a large measure of the <i>murumuru</i> nuts, and gave them to
the mule, patting the creature upon the nose, and thanking her for
the important service she had rendered.</p>

<p>When Don Pablo and the rest returned, the adventure was, of
course, related; but from the description given of the animal, neither
Don Pablo nor Guapo believed it could have been the jaguar. It was
too small for that. Besides a jaguar would not have been cowed and
driven off by a mule. He would more likely have killed the mule,
and dragged its body off with him across the river, or perhaps have
broken into the house, and done worse.</p>

<p>The animal was, no doubt, the &ldquo;ocelot,&rdquo; which is also spotted, or
rather marked with the eye-like rosettes which distinguish the skin of
the jaguar. Indeed, there are quite a number of animals of the cat
genus in the forests of the Monta&ntilde;a; some spotted like the leopard,
others striped as the tiger, and still others of uniform colour all over
the body. They are, of course, all preying animals, but none of them
will attack man, except the jaguar and the puma. Some of the
others, when brought to bay, will fight desperately, as would the
common wild cat under like circumstances; but the largest of them
will leave man alone, if unmolested themselves. Not so with the
jaguar, who will attack either man or beast, and put them to death,
unless he be himself overpowered.</p>

<p>The jaguar, or, as he is sometimes called, &ldquo;ounce,&rdquo; and by most
Spanish-Americans &ldquo;tiger,&rdquo; is the largest and most ferocious of all
the American <i>Felid&aelig;</i>. He stands third in rank as to these
qualities&mdash;the lion and tiger of the Eastern continent taking precedence of
him. Specimens of the jaguar have been seen equal in size to the
Asiatic tiger; but the average size of the American animal is much
less. He is strong enough, however, to drag a dead horse or ox to
his den&mdash;often to a distance of a quarter of a mile&mdash;and this feat has
been repeatedly observed.</p>

<p>The jaguar is found throughout all the tropical countries of Spanish
America, and is oftener called tiger than jaguar. This is a misapplied
name; for although he bears a considerable likeness to the
tiger, both in shape and habits, yet the markings of his skin are
quite different. The tiger is striated or striped, while the black on
the jaguar is in beautiful eye-like rosettes. The leopard is more like
the jaguar than any other creature; and the panther and cheetah of
the Eastern continent also resemble him. The markings of the
jaguar, when closely examined, differ from all of these. The spots
on the animals of the old world are simple spots or black rings, while
those of the American species are rings with a single spot in the
middle, forming <i>ocell&aelig;</i>, or eyes. Each, in fact, resembles a rosette.</p>

<p>Jaguars are not always of the same colour. Some have skins
of an orange yellow, and these are the most beautiful. Others are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
lighter-coloured; and individuals have been killed that were nearly
white. But there is a &ldquo;black jaguar,&rdquo; which is thought to be of a
different species. It is larger and fiercer than the other, and is found
in the very hottest parts of the Great Monta&ntilde;a. Its skin is not
quite jet-black, but of a deep maroon brown; and upon close inspection,
the spots upon it can be seen of a pure black. This species
is more dreaded by the inhabitants of those countries than the
other; and it is said always to attack man wherever it may encounter
him.</p>

<p>In the forests of South America, the jaguar reigns with undisputed
sway. All the other beasts fear, and fly from him. His roar produces
terror and confusion among the animated creation, and causes
them to fly in every direction. It is never heard by the Indian
without some feeling of fear,&mdash;and no wonder; for a year does not
pass without a number of these people falling victims to the savage
ferocity of this animal.</p>

<p>There are those, however, among them who can deal single-handed
with the jaguar,&mdash;regular &ldquo;jaguar-hunters&rdquo; by profession,&mdash;who do
not fear to attack the fierce brute in his own haunts. They do not
trust to fire-arms, but to a sharp spear. Upon this they receive his
attack, transfixing the animal with unerring aim as he advances.
Should they fail in their first thrust, their situation is one of peril;
yet all hope is not lost. On their left arm they carry a sort of
sheep-skin shield. This is held forward, and usually seized by the
jaguar; and while he is busy with it, the hunter gains time for a
second effort, which rarely fails to accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>The jaguars are killed for many reasons. Their beautiful skins
sell for several dollars; besides, in many places a price is set upon
their heads, on account of their destructive habits. Thousands are
destroyed every year. For all this, they do not seem to diminish in
numbers. The introduction of the large mammalia into America has
provided them with increased resources; and in many places, where
there are herds of half-wild cattle, the number of the jaguars is said
to be greater than formerly. It is difficult for one, living in a
country where such fierce animals are unknown, to believe that they
may have an influence over man to such an extent as to prevent his
settling in a particular place; yet such is the fact. In many parts
of South America, not only plantations, but whole villages, have been
abandoned solely from fear of the jaguars!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<div class="cap">A FAMILY OF JAGUARS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span>s yet none of the exiles had seen any tracks or indications of the
terrible jaguar, and Don Pablo began to believe that there were none
in that district of country. He was not allowed to remain much
longer in this belief, for an incident occurred shortly after proving
that at least one pair of these fierce animals was not far off.</p>

<p>It was near the end of the summer, and the cinchona-trees on the
side of the river on which stood the house had been all cut down and
&ldquo;barked.&rdquo; It became necessary, therefore, to cross the stream in
search of others. Indeed, numerous &ldquo;manchas&rdquo; had been seen on the
other side, and to these the &ldquo;cascarilleros&rdquo; now turned their attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
They, of course, reached them by crossing the tree-bridge, and then
keeping up the stream on the farther side.</p>

<p>For several days they had been at work in this new direction, and
were getting bark in by the hundred-weight.</p>

<p>One day Guapo and Leon had gone by themselves&mdash;Guapo to fell
the trees as usual, and Leon who was now an expert bark-peeler, to
use the scalping-knife. Don Pablo had remained at home, busy with
work in the great magazine, for there was much to do there in the
packing and storing.</p>

<p>An hour or two after, Guapo was seen to return alone. He had
broken the handle of his axe, and having, several spare ones at the
house, he had returned to get one. Leon had remained in the woods.</p>

<p>Now Leon had finished his operations on such trees as Guapo had
already cut down, and not finding a good seat near, had walked
towards the precipice which was farther up the hill, and sat down
upon one of the loose rocks at its base. Here he amused himself by
watching the parrots and toucans that were fluttering through the
trees over his head.</p>

<p>He noticed that just by his side there was a large hole or cave in
the cliff. He could see to the further end of it from where he sat, but
curiosity prompted him to step up to its mouth, and gave it a closer
examination. On doing so, he heard a noise, not unlike the mew of a
cat. It evidently came from the cave, and only increased his curiosity
to look inside. He put his head to the entrance, and there, in a sort
of nest, upon the bottom of the cave, he perceived two creatures,
exactly like two spotted kittens, only larger. They were about half
as big as full-grown cats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two beauties!&rdquo; said Leon to himself; &ldquo;they are the kittens of
some wild cat&mdash;that's plain. Now we want a cat very much at home.
If these were brought up in the house, why shouldn't they do? I'll
warrant they'd be tame enough. I know mamma wants a cat. I've
heard her say so. I'll give her an agreeable surprise by taking this
pair home.&mdash;The beauties!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without another word Leon climbed up, and taking hold of the two
spotted animals, returned with them out of the cave. They were
evidently very young creatures, yet for all that they growled, and
spat, and attempted to scratch his hands; but Leon was not a boy to
be frightened at trifles, and after getting one under each arm, he set
off in triumph, intending to carry them direct to the house.</p>

<p>Guapo was in front of the house busy in new-hafting his axe. Don
Pablo was at his work in the store-room. Do&ntilde;a Isidora and the little
Leona were occupied with some affair in the porch. All were
engaged one way or other. Just then a voice sounded upon their
ears, causing them all to stop their work, and look abroad. It even
brought Don Pablo out of the storehouse. It was the voice of Leon,
who shouted from the other side of the lake, where they all saw him
standing, with a strange object under each arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hola!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Look, mamma! See what I've got! I've
brought you a couple of cats&mdash;beauties, ain't they?&rdquo; And as he said
this, he held the two yellow bodies out before him.</p>

<p>Don Pablo turned pale, and even the coppery cheek of Guapo
blanched at the sight. Though at some distance, both knew at a
glance what they were. Cats, indeed! <i>They were the cubs of the
jaguar!</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Don Pablo, hoarse with affright. &ldquo;My God! the
boy will be lost!&rdquo; and as he spoke he swept the upper edge of the
lake with an anxious glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, little master!&rdquo; shouted Guapo. &ldquo;Run for your life; make
for the bridge&mdash;for the bridge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leon seemed astonished. He knew by the words of Guapo, and the
earnest gestures of the rest, that there was some danger:&mdash;but of
what? Why was he to run? He could not comprehend it. He
hesitated, and might have stayed longer on the spot, had not his
father, seeing his indecision, shouted out to him in a loud voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, boy! run! The jaguars are after you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech enabled Leon to comprehend his situation for the first
time, and he immediately started off towards the bridge, running as
fast as he was able.</p>

<p>Don Pablo had not seen the jaguars when he spoke, but his words
were prophetic, and that prophecy was speedily verified. They had
hardly been uttered when two yellow bodies, dashing out of the brushwood,
appeared near the upper end of the lake. There was no
mistaking what they were. Their orange flanks and ocellated sides
were sufficiently characteristic. <i>They were jaguars!</i></p>

<p>A few springs brought them to the edge of the water, and they
were seen to take the track over which Leon had just passed. They
were following by the scent&mdash;sometimes pausing&mdash;sometimes one
passing the other&mdash;and their waving tails and quick energetic movements
showed that they were furious and excited to the highest
degree. Now they disappeared behind the palm-trunks, and the
next moment their shining bodies shot out again like flashes of light.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Isidora and the little Leona screamed with affright. Don
Pablo shouted words of encouragement in a hoarse voice. Guapo
seized his axe&mdash;which fortunately he had finished hafting&mdash;and ran
towards the bridge, along the water's edge. Don Pablo followed with
his pistols, which he had hastily got his hands upon.</p>

<p>For a short moment there was silence on both sides of the river.
Guapo was opposite Leon, both running. The stream narrowed as it
approached the ravine, and Leon and Guapo could see each other,
and hear every word distinctly. Guapo now cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop one! young master&mdash;<i>only one</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leon heard, and, being a sharp boy, understood what was meant.
Up to this moment he had not thought of parting with his &ldquo;cats&rdquo;&mdash;in
fact, it was because he had <i>not</i> thought of it. Now, however, at
the voice of Guapo, he flung one of them to the ground, without
stopping to see where it fell. He ran on, and in a few seconds again
heard Guapo cry out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Now the other!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leon let the second slip from his grasp, and kept on for the bridge.</p>

<p>It was well he had dropped the cubs, else he would never have
reached that bridge. When the first one fell the jaguars were not
twenty paces behind him. They were almost in sight, but by good
fortune the weeds and underwood hid the pursued from the pursuers.</p>

<p>On reaching their young, the first that had been dropped, both
stopped, and appeared to lick and caress it. They remained by it
but a moment. One parted sooner than the other&mdash;the female it was,
no doubt, in search of her second offspring. Shortly after the other
started also, and both were again seen springing along the trail in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
pursuit. A few stretches brought them to where the second cub lay,
and here they again halted, caressing this one as they had done the
other.</p>

<p>Don Pablo and Do&ntilde;a Isidora, who saw all this from the other side,
were in hopes that having recovered their young, the jaguars might
give over their chase, and carry them off. But they were mistaken
in this. The American tiger is of a very different nature. Once
enraged, he will seek revenge with relentless pertinacity. It so
proved. After delaying a moment with the second cub. Both left it,
and sprang forward upon the trail, which they knew had been taken
by whoever had robbed them.</p>

<p>By this time Leon had gained the bridge&mdash;had crossed it&mdash;and was
lifted from its nearer end by Guapo. The latter scarce spoke a word&mdash;only
telling Leon to hurry towards the house. For himself he had
other work to do than run. The bridge he knew would be no protection.
The jaguars would cross over it like squirrels, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Guapo reflected no further, but bending over the thick branch,
attacked it with his axe. His design was apparent at once. He was
going to cut it from the cliff!</p>

<p>He plied the axe with all his might. Every muscle in his body
was at play. Blow succeeded blow. The branch was already creaking,
when, to his horror, the foremost of the jaguars appeared in
sight on the opposite side! He was not discouraged. Again fell the
axe&mdash;again and again; the jaguar is upon the bank; it has sprung
upon the root of the tree! It pauses a moment&mdash;another blow of
the axe&mdash;the jaguar bounds upon the trunk&mdash;its claws rattle along
the bark&mdash;it is midway over the chasm! Another blow&mdash;the branch
crackles&mdash;there is a crash&mdash;it parts from the cliff&mdash;it is gone! Both
tree and jaguar gone&mdash;down&mdash;down to the sharp rocks of the
foaming torrent!</p>

<p>A loud yell from the Indian announced his triumph. But it was
not yet complete. It was the female jaguar&mdash;the smaller one that
had fallen. The male still remained&mdash;where was he? Already upon
the opposite brink of the chasm!</p>

<p>He had dashed forward, just in time to see his mate disappearing
into the gulf below. He saw, and seemed to comprehend all that
had passed. His eyes glared with redoubled fury. There was
vengeance in his look, and determination in his attitude.</p>

<p>For a moment he surveyed the wide gulf that separated him from
his enemies. He seemed to measure the distance at a glance. His
heart was bold with rage and despair. He had lost his companion&mdash;his
faithful partner&mdash;his wife. Life was nothing now&mdash;he resolved
upon revenge or death!</p>

<p>He was seen to run a few paces back from the edge of the chasm,
and then turning suddenly, set his body for the spring.</p>

<p>It would have been beautiful to have beheld the play of his
glistening flanks at that moment had one been out of danger; but
Guapo was not, and he had no pleasure in the sight. Guapo stood
upon the opposite brink, axe in hand, ready to receive him.</p>

<p>The Indian had not long to wait. With one desperate bound the
jaguar launched his body into the air, and, like lightning, passed to
the opposite bank. His fore-feet only reached it, and his claws
firmly grasped the rock. The rest of his body hung over, clutching
the cliff!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>In a moment he would have sprung up, and then woe to his
antagonist! but he was not allowed that moment, for he had
scarcely touched the rock when the Indian leaped forward and
struck at his head with the axe. The blow was not well aimed, and
although it stunned the jaguar, he still clung to the cliff. In setting
himself for a second blow, Guapo came too near, and the next
moment the great claws of the tiger were buried in his foot!</p>

<p>It is difficult to tell what might have been the result. It would,
no doubt, have been different. Guapo would have been dragged
over, and that was certain death; but at this moment a hand was
protruded between Guapo's legs&mdash;the muzzle of a pistol was seen
close to the head of the jaguar&mdash;a loud crack rang through the
ravine, and when the smoke cleared away the jaguar was seen no
more!</p>

<p>Guapo, with his foot badly lacerated, was drawn back from the
cliff into the arms of Don Pablo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE RAFT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>his was the most exciting day that had been passed since their
arrival in the Monta&ntilde;a; and considering the result it was well that
the occurrence had taken place. It had rid them of a pair of bad
neighbours&mdash;there would soon have been four&mdash;that some time or
other would have endangered the lives of some of the party. It was
the opinion of Guapo that they need not, at least for a while, have
any fear of jaguars. It was not likely there was another pair in that
district; although, from the roaming disposition of this animal,
fresh ones might soon make their appearance; and it was deemed
best always to act as though some were already in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The cubs were disposed of. It was not deemed advisable to bring
them up as &ldquo;cats.&rdquo; After what had occurred that was voted, even
by Leon, a dangerous experiment&mdash;too dangerous to be attempted.
They were still on the other side of the river, and the bridge was
now gone. If left to themselves, no doubt they would have
perished, as they were very young things. Perhaps some carnivorous
creature&mdash;wolf, coati, eagle, or vulture&mdash;would have devoured them,
or they might have been eaten up by the ants. But this was not
to be their fate. Guapo swam across, and strangled them. Then
tying them together, he suspended the pair over his shoulders, and
brought them with him to be exhibited as a curiosity. Moreover
Guapo had a design upon their skins.</p>

<p>It was not long after that a pleasanter pet than either of them
was found, and this was a beautiful little sa&iuml;miri monkey, about the
size of a squirrel, which Guapo and Leon captured one day in the
woods. They heard a noise as they were passing along, and going
up to the spot, saw on the branch of a low tree nearly a dozen little
monkeys all rolled up together in a heap with their tails wrapped
round each other as if to keep themselves warm.</p>

<p>Nearly another dozen were running about, whining and apparently
trying to get in among the rest. Guapo and Leon made a sudden
rush upon them, and were able to capture three or four before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
the creatures could free themselves; but only one lived, and that
became a great pet and favourite. It was a beautiful little creature&mdash;a
true sa&iuml;miri, or squirrel-monkey, called the &ldquo;titi.&rdquo; Its silky fur
was of a rich olive-green colour; and its fine large eyes expressed
fear or joy&mdash;now filling with tears, and now brightening again&mdash;just
like those of a child.</p>

<p>During the summer our bark-gatherers continued their labour
without interruption, and on account of the great plenty of the
cinchona-trees, and their proximity to the house, they were enabled
to accumulate a very large store. They worked like bees.</p>

<p>Although this forest life was not without its pleasures and excitements,
yet it began to grow very irksome both to Don Pablo and
Do&ntilde;a Isidora. Life in the wilderness, with its rude cares and rude
enjoyments, may be very pleasant for a while to those who seek it
as amateurs, or to that class who as colonists intend to make it
a permanent thing. But neither Don Pablo nor his wife had ever
thought of colonisation. With them their present industry was the
result of accident and necessity. Their tastes and longings were
very different. They longed to return to civilised life; and though
the very misfortune which had driven them forth into the wilderness
had also guided them to an opportunity of making a fortune, it is
probable they would have passed it by, had they not known that,
penniless as they were, they would have fared still worse in any city
to which they might have gone.</p>

<p>But before the first year was out, they yearned very much to
return to civilisation, and this desire was very natural. But there
were other reasons that influenced them besides the mere <i>ennui</i> of
the wilderness. The lives of themselves and their children were
constantly in danger from jaguars, pumas, and poisonous reptiles.
Even man himself might at any moment appear as their destroyer.
As yet no Indian&mdash;not even a trace of one&mdash;had been seen. But this
was not strange.</p>

<p>In the tangled and impenetrable forests of the Great Monta&ntilde;a two
tribes of Indians may reside for years within less than a league's
distance of each other, without either being aware of the other's
existence! Scarcely any intercourse is carried on, or excursions
made, except by the rivers&mdash;for they are the only roads&mdash;and where
two of these run parallel, although they may be only at a short
distance from each other, people residing on one may never think of
crossing to the other.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that no Indians had yet appeared to disturb
them, there was no certainty that these might not arrive any day,
and treat them as enemies. On this account, Don Pablo and Do&ntilde;a
Isidora were never without a feeling of uneasiness.</p>

<p>After mutual deliberation, therefore, they resolved not to prolong
their stay beyond the early part of spring, when they would carry
out their original design of building a <i>balza</i> raft, and commit themselves
to the great river, which, according to all appearance, and to
Guapo's confident belief, flowed directly to the Amazon. Guapo had
never either descended or ascended it himself, and on their first
arrival was not so sure about its course; but after having gone down
to its banks, and examined its waters, his recollections revived, and
he remembered many accounts which he had heard of it from Indians
of his own tribe. He had no doubt but it was the same which, under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
the name of the &ldquo;Purus,&rdquo; falls into the Amazon between the mouths
of the Madeira and the Coary.</p>

<p>Upon this stream, therefore, in a few months they would embark.
But these intervening months were not spent in idleness. Although
the season for bark-gathering was past, another source of industry
presented itself. The bottom lands of the great river were found to
be covered with a network of underwood, and among this underwood
the principal plant was a well-known briar, <i>Smilax officinalis</i>. This
is the creeping plant that yields the celebrated &ldquo;sarsaparilla;&rdquo; and
Don Pablo, having made an analysis of some roots, discovered it to be
the most valuable species&mdash;for it is to be remembered, that, like the
cinchona, a whole genus, or rather several genera, furnish the article
of commerce.</p>

<p>The briar which produces the sarsaparilla is a tall creeping plant,
which throws out a large number of long wrinkled roots of a uniform
thickness, and about the size of a goose-quill. Nothing is required
further than digging and dragging these roots out of the ground,
drying them a while, and then binding them in bundles with a small
&ldquo;sipo,&rdquo; or tough forest creeper. These bundles are made up, so as to
render the roots convenient for packing and transport.</p>

<p>During several months this branch of industry occupied Don Pablo,
Guapo, and Leon; so that when the time drew nigh for their departure,
what with the cinchona-bark, the sarsaparilla, and the
vanilla-beans, there was not an empty inch in the large storehouse.</p>

<p>Guapo had not been all the time with them. For several days
Gruapo was not to be seen at the house, nor anywhere around it.
Where had Guapo been all this time? I will tell you; Guapo <i>had
been to the mountains</i>!</p>

<p>Yes, Don Pablo had sent him on an important mission, which he
had performed with secrecy and despatch. Don Pablo, before braving
the dangers of the vast journey he had projected, had still a lingering
hope that something might have happened&mdash;some change in the
government of Peru&mdash;perhaps a new Viceroy&mdash;that might enable him
to return with safety to his native land. To ascertain if such had
taken place, Guapo had made his journey to the mountains.</p>

<p>He went no farther than the Puna&mdash;no farther than the hut of his
friend the vaquero&mdash;who, by a previous understanding with Guapo,
had kept himself informed about political matters.</p>

<p>There was no hope; the same Council, the same Viceroy, the same
price upon the head of Don Pablo&mdash;who, however, was believed to
have escaped in an American ship, and to have taken refuge in the
great Republic of the North.</p>

<p>With this news Guapo returned, and now the preparations for the
river voyage were set about in earnest. A balza raft was built out of
large trunks of the <i>Bombax ceiba</i>, which, being light wood, was the
best for the purpose. Of course these trunks had been cut long ago
with a view to using them in this way. A commodious cabin, or
&ldquo;toldo,&rdquo; was constructed on the raft, built of palm and bamboos, and
thatched with the broad leaves of the bussu. A light canoe was also
hollowed out, as a sort of tender to the raft, and a couple of very
large canoes for the purpose of giving buoyancy to it, were lashed
one upon each side. The &ldquo;merchandise&rdquo; was carefully &ldquo;stowed&rdquo; and
covered with &ldquo;tarpaulins&rdquo; of palm-leaves, and the stores laid in with
every providential care and calculation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>You will be wondering what was done with the horse and mule,&mdash;those
creatures who had served the exiles so faithfully and so well?
Were they left behind to become a prey to the jaguars and the large
blood-sucking bats, that kill so many animals in these parts? No&mdash;they
were not to be left to such a fate. One of them&mdash;the mule&mdash;had
been already disposed of. It was a valuable beast, and partly on that
account, and partly from gratitude felt towards it for the well-timed
kick it had given the ocelot, it was to be spared. Guapo had taken
both the mule and the horse on his mountain journey, and presented
the former to his friend the vaquero.</p>

<p>But the horse was still on hand. What was to be done with him?
Leave him behind? That would be certain death, for no horse, that
was not cared for, could exist in the Monta&ntilde;a ten days without being
eaten up by the fierce creatures that inhabit it. The bats would
surely have destroyed him. Well, what was done? He could not be
carried on the raft. But he was, though,&mdash;<i>in a way</i>.</p>

<p>Guapo was resolved that the bats should not have him, nor the
jaguars neither. He was in fine condition&mdash;fat as a pig. The fruit of
the murumuru had agreed with him. He was just in the condition
in which an Indian thinks a horse &ldquo;good for killing,&rdquo; and <i>Guapo
killed him</i>! Yes, Guapo killed him! It is true it was a sort of a
Virginius tragedy, and Guapo had great difficulty in nerving himself
for the task. But the blow-gun was at length levelled, and the <i>curare</i>
did its work. Then Guapo skinned him, and cut him into strips, and
dried him into &ldquo;charqui,&rdquo; and carried him on board the raft. That
was the closing scene.</p>

<p>All left the house together, carrying with them the remains of their
hastily-created <i>penates</i>. On reaching the end of the valley, they
turned and threw back a last glance at a home that had to them been
a happy one; and then, continuing their journey, they were soon
upon the balza. The only living creature that accompanied them
from their valley home was the pretty sa&iuml;miri, carried on the shoulder
of the little Leona.</p>

<p>The cable of piassaba-palm was carefully taken in and coiled, the
raft was pushed out, and the next moment floated lightly upon the
broad bosom of the river.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE GUARDIAN BROTHER.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he current of the river flowed at the rate of about four miles an
hour, and at this speed they travelled. They had nothing to do but
guide the raft in the middle part of the stream. This was effected by
means of a large stern-oar fixed upon a pivot, and which served the
purpose of a rudder. One was required to look after this oar, and
Don Pablo and Guapo took turns at it. It was not a very troublesome
task, except where some bend had to be got round, or some eddy
was to be cleared, when both had to work at it together. At other
times the balza floated straight on, without requiring the least effort
on the part of the crew; and then they would all sit down and chat
pleasantly, and view the changing scenery of the forest-covered shores.</p>

<p>Sometimes tall palms lined the banks, and sometimes great forest
trees netted together by thick parasites that crept from one to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
other, and twined around the trunks like monster serpents. Sometimes
the shores were one unbroken thicket of underwood, where it
would have been almost impossible to make a landing had they wished
it. At other places there were sand-bars, and even little islets with
scarce any vegetation upon them; and they also passed many other
islets and large islands thickly wooded. The country generally
appeared to be flat, though at one or two places they saw hills that
ran in to the banks of the river.</p>

<p>Of course the change of scenery, and the many fresh vistas continually
opening before them, rendered their voyage both cheerful and
interesting. The many beautiful birds too, and new kinds of trees
and animals which they saw, were a constant source of varied enjoyment,
and furnished them with themes of conversation.</p>

<p>During the first day they made a journey of full forty miles.
Having brought their balza close to the shore, and secured it to a
tree, they encamped for the night. There was no opening of any
extent, but for some distance the ground was clear of underwood, and
the trunks of great old trees rose like columns losing themselves
amidst the thick foliage overhead. A dark forest only could be seen,
and, as night drew on, the horrid cries of the alouattes, or howling
monkeys, mingling with the voices of other nocturnal animals, filled
the woods. They had no fear of monkeys, but now and then they
thought they could distinguish the cry of the jaguar, and of him they
had fear enough. Indeed the jaguar possesses the power of imitating
the cry of the other animals of the forest, and often uses it to draw
them within reach of him.</p>

<p>In addition to the fire upon which they had cooked their supper,
as soon as night had fairly set in, they kindled others, forming a sort
of semicircle, the chord of which was the bank of the river itself.
Within this semicircle the hammocks were stretched from tree to
tree; and, as all were fatigued with the day's exertions, they climbed
into them at an early hour, and were soon asleep. One alone sat up
to keep watch. As they thought they had heard the jaguar, this was
deemed best; for they knew that fire will not always frighten off that
fierce animal. As the neighbourhood looked suspicious, and also as it
was their first encampment, they, like all travellers at setting out, of
course were more timid and cautious.</p>

<p>To Leon was assigned the first watch; for Leon was a courageous
boy, and it was not the first time he had taken his turn in this way.
He was to sit up for about two hours, and then wake Guapo, who
would keep the midnight watch; after which Don Pablo's turn would
come, and that would terminate in the morning at daybreak. Leon
was instructed to rouse the others in case any danger might threaten
the camp.</p>

<p>Leon from choice had seated himself by the head of the hammock
in which slept the little Leona; in order, no doubt, to be nearer her,
as she was the most helpless of the party, and therefore required
more immediate protection. He had both the pistols by him&mdash;ready
to his hand and loaded&mdash;and in case of danger he knew very well
how to use them.</p>

<p>He had been seated for about half-an-hour, now casting his eyes
up to the red and wrinkled trunks of the trees, and then gazing into
the dark vistas of the surrounding forest, or at other times looking
out upon the glistening surface of the river. Many a strange sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
fell upon his ear. Sometimes the whole forest appeared to be alive
with voices&mdash;the voices of beasts and birds, reptiles, and insects&mdash;for
the tree-frogs and ciendas were as noisy as the larger creatures. At
other times a perfect stillness reigned, so that he could distinctly
hear the tiny hum of the mosquito; and then, all at once, would fall
upon his ear the melancholy wailing of the night-hawk&mdash;the &ldquo;<i>alma
perdida</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;lost soul&rdquo;&mdash;for such is the poetical and fanciful name
given by the Spanish Americans to this nocturnal bird.</p>

<p>While thus engaged Leon began to feel very drowsy. The heavy
day's work, in which he had borne part, had fatigued him as well as
the others; and, in spite of the odd voices that from time to time fell
upon his ear, he could have lain down upon the bare ground and
slept without a feeling of fear. Snakes or scorpions, or biting lizards
or spiders, would not have kept him from going to sleep at that
moment. It is astonishing how the desire of sleep makes one indifferent
to all these things, which at other times we so much dread.
Leon did not fear them a bit, but kept himself awake from a feeling
of pride and honour. He reflected that it would never do to be unfaithful
to the important trust confided to him. No; that would
never do. He rubbed his eyes, and rose up, and approached the
bank, and dipped his hands in the water, and came back to his former
place, and sat down again. Spite of all his efforts, however, he felt
very heavy. Oh! when would the two hours pass that he might
rouse Guapo?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Car-r-ambo! I nev-er was so s-s-sleepy. <i>Vamos</i>! Leon! you
mustn't give in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And striking himself a lively slap on the chest, he straightened
his back, and sat upright for a while.</p>

<p>He was just beginning to get bowed about the shoulders again,
and to nod a little, when he was startled by a short sharp exclamation
uttered by the little Leona. He looked up to her hammock.
He could perceive it had moved slightly, but it was at rest again,
and its occupant was evidently asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little sis! she is dreaming,&rdquo; he muttered half aloud. &ldquo;Perhaps
some horrid dream of jaguars or serpents. I have half a mind
to awake her. But, no, she sleeps too soundly; I might disturb
them all;&rdquo; and with these reflections Leon remained upon his seat.</p>

<p>Once more his head was beginning to bob, when the voice of Leona
again startled him, and he looked up as before. The hammock moved
slightly, but there was no appearance of anything wrong. From
where he sat he could not see well into it, but the outlines of the
child's body were easily discernible through the elastic netting; and
at the farther end he could just perceive one of her little feet, where
it had escaped from the covering, and rested partly over the edge.</p>

<p>As he continued to gaze upon the delicate member, thinking
whether he had not better cover it against the mosquitoes, all at
once his eye was attracted by something red&mdash;a crooked red line that
traversed from the toe downward along the side of the foot. It was
red and glittering&mdash;it was <i>a stream of blood</i>!</p>

<p>His first feeling was one of horror. His next was a resolve to
spring to his feet and rouse the camp, but this impulse was checked
by one of greater prudence. Whatever enemy had done it, thought
he, must still be about the hammock; to make a noise would, perhaps,
only irritate it, and cause it to inflict some still more terrible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
wound. He would remain quiet, until he had got his eyes upon the
creature, when he could spring upon it, or fire his pistol before it
could do further harm.</p>

<p>With these ideas, quickly conceived, he rose silently to his feet,
and standing, or rather crouching forward, bent his eyes over the
hammock.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE VAMPIRE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">L</span>eon's head was close to that of the sleeper, whose sweet breath he
felt, and whose little bosom rose and fell in gentle undulation. He
scanned the inside of the hammock from head to foot. He gazed
anxiously into every fold of the cover. Not an object could he see
that should not have been there&mdash;no terrible creature&mdash;no serpent&mdash;for
it was this last that was in his mind. But something must have
been there. What could have caused the stream of blood, that now
being closer he could more plainly see trickling over the soft blue
veins? Some creature must have done it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! if it be the small viper,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;or the coral snake, or
the deadly macaurel! If these&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;.</p>

<p>His thoughts at this moment were interrupted. A light flapping
of wings sounded in his ear&mdash;so light, that it appeared to be made by
the soft pinions of the owl, or some nocturnal bird. It was not by
the wings of a bird that that sound was produced, but by the wings
of a hideous creature. Leon was conscious, from the continued
flapping, that something was playing through the air, and that it
occasionally approached close to his head. He gazed upward and
around him, and at length he could distinguish a dark form passing
between him and the light; but it glided into the darkness again,
and he could see it no more.</p>

<p>Was it a bird? It looked like one&mdash;it might have been an owl&mdash;it
was full as large as one; but yet, from the glance he had had of it, it
appeared to be black or very dark, and he had never heard of owls of
that colour. Moreover, it had not the look nor flight of an owl.
Was it a bird at all? or whatever it was, was it the cause of the
blood? This did not appear likely to Leon, who still had his
thoughts bent upon the snakes.</p>

<p>While he was revolving these questions in his mind, he again
turned and looked toward the foot of the hammock. The sight
caused him a thrill of horror. There was the hideous creature,
which, he had just seen, right over the bleeding foot. It was not
perched, but suspended in the air on its moving wings, with its long
snout protruded forward and pressed against the toe of the sleeper!
Its sharp white teeth were visible in both jaws, and its small vicious
eyes glistened under the light of the fires. The red hair covering its
body and large membranous wings added to the hideousness of its
aspect, and a more hideous creature could not have been conceived.
<i>It was the vampire</i>,&mdash;the blood-sucking <i>phyllostoma</i>!</p>

<p>A short cry escaped from the lips of Leon. It was not a cry of
pain, but the contrary. The sight of the great bat, hideous as the
creature was, relieved him. He had all along been under the painful
impression that some venomous serpent had caused the blood to flow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
and now he had no further fear on that score. He knew that there
was no poison in the wound inflicted by the phyllostoma&mdash;only the
loss of a little blood; and this quieted his anxieties at once. He
resolved, however, to punish the intruder; and not caring to rouse
the camp by firing, he stole a little closer, and aimed a blow with the
butt of his pistol.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/illus-266.jpg" width="347" height="500" alt="THE VAMPIRE BAT." title="THE VAMPIRE BAT." />
<span class="caption">THE VAMPIRE BAT.</span></div>

<p>The blow was well aimed, and brought the bat to the ground,
but its shrill screeching awoke everybody, and in a few moments the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
camp was in complete confusion. The sight of the blood on the foot
of the little Leona quite terrified Do&ntilde;a Isidora and the rest; but
when the cause was explained, all felt reassured and thankful that
the thing was no worse. The little foot was bound up in a rag; and
although, for two or three days after, it was not without pain, yet no
bad effects came of it.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;blood-sucking&rdquo; bats do not cause death either to man, or any
other animal, by a single attack. All the blood they can draw out
amounts to only a few ounces, although after their departure, the
blood continues to run from the open wound. It is by repeating
their attacks night after night that the strength of an animal becomes
exhausted, and it dies from sheer loss of blood and consequent faintness.
With animals this is far from being a rare occurrence.
Hundreds of horses and cattle are killed every year in the South
American pastures. These creatures suffer, perhaps, without knowing
from what cause, for the phyllostoma performs its cupping
operation without causing the least pain&mdash;at all events the sleeper is
very rarely awakened by it.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand how it sucks the blood of its victim, for its
snout and the leafy appendage around its mouth&mdash;from whence it
derives the name &ldquo;phyllostoma&rdquo;&mdash;are admirably adapted to that end.
But how does it make the puncture to &ldquo;let&rdquo; the blood? That is as
yet a mystery among naturalists, as it also is among the people
who are habitually its victims. Even Guapo could not explain the
process. The large teeth&mdash;of which it has got quite a mouthful&mdash;seem
altogether unfitted to make a hole such as is found where the
&ldquo;phyllostoma&rdquo; has been at work. Their bite, moreover, would awake
the soundest sleeper.</p>

<p>Besides these, it has neither fangs, nor stings, nor proboscis, that
would serve the purpose. How then does its reach the blood? Many
theories have been offered; some assert that it rubs the skin with its
snout until its brings it to bleeding: others say that it sets the sharp
point of one of its large tusks against the part, and then by plying
its wings wheels round and round, as upon a pivot, until the point
has penetrated&mdash;that during this operation the motion of the wings
fans and cools the sleeping victim, so that no pain is felt. It may be
a long while before this curious question is solved, on account of the
difficulty of observing a creature whose habits are nocturnal, and
most of whose deeds are &ldquo;done in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>People have denied the existence of such a creature as the blood-sucking
bat&mdash;even naturalists have gone so far. They can allege no
better grounds for their incredulity than that the thing has an air of
the fabulous and horrible about it. But this is not philosophy.
Incredulity is the characteristic of the half-educated. It may be
carried too far, and the fables of the vulgar have often a stratum of
truth at the bottom. There is one thing that is almost intolerable,
and that is the conceit of the &ldquo;closet-naturalist,&rdquo; who sneers at
everything as untrue that seems to show the least <i>design</i> on the part
of the brute creation&mdash;who denies everything that appears at all
singular or fanciful, and simply because it appears so. With the
truthful observations that have been made upon the curious domestic
economy of such little creatures as bees, and wasps, and ants, we
ought to be cautious how we reject statements about the habits of
other animals, however strange they may appear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>Who doubts that a mosquito will perch itself upon the skin of a human
being, pierce it with its proboscis, and suck away until it is gorged
with blood! Why does it appear strange that a bat should do the same?</p>

<p>Now your closet-naturalist will believe that the bat <i>does</i> suck the
blood of cattle and horses, but denies that it will attack man! This
is sheer nonsense. What difference to the vampire, whether its
victim be a biped or quadruped? Is it fear of the former that would
prevent it from attacking him? Perhaps it may never have seen a
human being before: besides, it attacks its victim while asleep, and
is rarely ever caught or punished in the act. Where these creatures
are much hunted or persecuted by man, they may learn to fear him,
and their original habits may become changed, but that is quite
another thing.</p>

<p>As nature has formed them, the blood-sucking bats will make their
attack indifferently, either upon man or large quadrupeds. There
are a thousand proofs to be had in all the tropical regions of America.
Every year animals are killed by the <i>phyllostoma hastatum</i>, not in
hundreds, but in thousands. It is recorded that on one extensive
cattle-farm several hundred head were killed in the short period of
six months by the bats; and the vaqueros, who received a bounty
upon every bat they should capture, in one year succeeded in destroying
the enormous number of <i>seven thousand</i>! Indeed, &ldquo;bat-hunting&rdquo;
is followed by some as a profession, so eager are the owners
of the cattle-farms to get rid of these pests.</p>

<p>Many tribes of Indians and travellers suffer great annoyance from
the vampire-bats. Some persons never go to sleep without covering
themselves with blankets, although the heat be ever so oppressive.
Any part left naked will be attacked by the &ldquo;phyllostoma&rdquo;, but they
seem to have a preference for the tip of the great toe&mdash;perhaps because
they have found that part more habitually exposed. Sometimes
one sleeper is &ldquo;cupped&rdquo; by them, while another will not be
molested; and this, I may observe, is true also of the mosquitoes.
There may be some difference as to the state of the blood of two individuals,
that leads to this fastidious preference. Some are far more
subject to their attack than others&mdash;so much so that they require to
adopt every precaution to save themselves from being bled to death.
Cayenne pepper rubbed over the skin is used to keep them off, and
also to cure the wound they have made; but even this sometimes
proves ineffective.</p>

<p>Of course there are many species of bats in South America besides
the vampire; in fact, there is no class of mammalia more numerous
in genera and species, and no part of the world where greater numbers
are found than in the tropical regions of America. Some are insect-eaters,
while others live entirely on vegetable substances; but all have
the same unsightly and repulsive appearance. The odour of some kinds
is extremely fetid and disagreeable.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, they are eaten by many tribes of Indians,
and even the French Creoles of Guiana have their &ldquo;bat-soup,&rdquo; which
they relish highly. The proverb &ldquo;<i>De gustibus non disputandum est</i>,&rdquo;
seems to be true for all time. The Spanish Americans have it in the phrase
&ldquo;<i>Cada uno a su gusto</i>;&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Chacun &agrave; son go&ucirc;t</i>,&rdquo; say the French;
and on hearing these tales about &ldquo;ant-paste,&rdquo; and &ldquo;roast monkey,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;armidillo done in the shell,&rdquo; and &ldquo;bat-soup,&rdquo; you, boy reader,
will not fail to exclaim &ldquo;Every one to his liking.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>The vampire appeared to be to Guapo's liking. It was now his
turn to keep watch, and as the rest of them got into their hammocks,
and lay awake for a while, they saw him take up the bat, spit it upon
a forked stick, and commence broiling it over the fire. Of course <i>he
ate it</i>!</p>

<p>When morning came, and they had got up, what was their astonishment
to see no less than fourteen bats lying side by side!
They were dead, of course: Guapo had killed them all during his
watch. They had appeared at one period of the night in alarming
numbers, and Guapo had done battle manfully without awaking
anybody.</p>

<p>Another curious tableau came under their notice shortly after.
Just as they were about to embark, a singular looking tree was observed
growing near the bank of the river. At first they thought the tree
was covered with birds'-nests, or pieces of some kind of moss. Indeed,
it looked more like a tree hung over with rags than anything else.
Curiosity led them to approach it. What was their astonishment to
find that the nests, moss, or rags, were neither more or less than a
vast assemblage of bats suspended, and asleep! They were hanging
in all possible positions; some with their heads down, some by the
claws upon either wing, and some by both, while a great many had
merely hooked over the branch the little horny curvature of their
tails. Some hung down along the trunk, suspended by a crack in the
bark, while others were far out upon the branches.</p>

<p>It was certainly the oddest &ldquo;roost&rdquo; that any of the party (Guapo,
perhaps, excepted) had ever witnessed; and, after gazing at it for
some time, they turned away without disturbing the sleepers, and
getting on board once more, floated adown the stream swiftly and
silently.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE MARIMONDAS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>hat day they made good progress, having dropped down the river
a distance of fifty miles at least. They might even have gone farther,
but a good camping-place offered, and they did not like to pass it, as
they might not find another so convenient. It was a muddy bank,
or rather a promontory that ran out into the river, and was entirely
without trees, or any other vegetation, as it was annually overflowed,
and formed, in fact, part of the bed of the river. At this time the
mud was quite dry and smooth, and appeared as if it had been
paddled and beaten down by the feet of animals and birds. This
was, in fact, the case, for the point was a favourite resting-place for
the &ldquo;chiguires,&rdquo; or &ldquo;capivaras,&rdquo; on their passage to and from the
water. There were tracks of tapirs, too, and peccaries, and many
sorts of wading birds, that had been there while the mud was still
soft.</p>

<p>There were no trees to which to hang their hammocks, but the
ground was smooth and dry, and they could sleep well enough upon
it. They would not be troubled with the bats, as these creatures
keep mostly in the dark shadowy places of the forest; and snakes
would not likely be found out on the bare ground. They thought
they would there be safer from jaguars, too. In fact, it was from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
these considerations that they had chosen the place for their camp.
They could go to the woods for an armful or two of sticks to cook
supper with, and that would suffice.</p>

<p>The balza was brought close in on the upper side of the promontory,
so as to be out of the current; and then all landed and made
their preparations for passing the night. Guapo marched off with
his axe to get some firewood, and Leon accompanied him to assist
in carrying it. They had not far to go&mdash;only a hundred yards or so,
for up at the end of the promontory the forest began, and there
were both large trees and underwood.</p>

<p>As they walked forward one species of trees caught their attention.
They were palm-trees, but of a sort they had not yet met with. They
were very tall, with a thick, globe-shaped head of pinnate, plume-like
leaves. But what rendered these trees peculiar was the stem.
It was slender in proportion to the height of the tree, and was
thickly covered with long needle-shaped spines, not growing irregularly,
but set in bands, or rings, around the tree. This new palm
was the &ldquo;pupunha,&rdquo; or &ldquo;peach-palm,&rdquo; as it is called, from the
resemblance which its fruits bear to peaches. It is also named
&ldquo;pirijao&rdquo; in other parts of South America, and it belongs to the
genus &ldquo;<i>Gullielma</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the tops of these trees, under the great globe of leaves, Guapo
and Leon perceived the nuts. They were hanging in clusters, as
grapes grow; but the fruits were as large as apricots, of an oval,
triangular shape, and of a beautiful reddish yellow colour. That
they were delicious eating, either roasted or boiled, Guapo well
knew; and he was determined that some of them should be served
at supper. But how were they to be reached? No man could climb
such a tree as they grew upon! The needles would have torn the
flesh from any one who should have attempted it.</p>

<p>Guapo knew this. He knew, moreover, that the Indians, who are
very fond of the fruit of this tree,&mdash;so much so that they plant large
<i>palmares</i> of it around their villages&mdash;have a way of climbing it to
get at the ripe clusters. They tie cross pieces of wood from one tree
to the other, and thus make a sort of step-ladder, by which they
ascend to the fruit. It is true, they might easily cut down the trees,
as the trunks are not very thick; but that would be killing the
goose that gave the golden eggs.</p>

<p>Guapo, however, had no farther interest in this wild orchard than
to make it serve his turn for that one night; so, laying his axe to
one of the &ldquo;pupunhas,&rdquo; he soon levelled its majestic stem to the
ground. Nothing more remained than to lop off the clusters, any one
of which was as much as Leon could lift from the ground. Guapo
found the wood hard enough even in its green state, but when old it
becomes black, and is then so hard that it will turn the edge of an
axe. There is, perhaps, no wood in all South America harder than
that of the pirijao palm.</p>

<p>It is with the needle-like spines of this species that many tribes of
Indians puncture their skins in tattooing themselves, and other uses
are made by them of different parts of this noble tree. The macaws,
parrots, and other fruit-eating birds, are fonder of the nuts of the
pupunha than perhaps any other species; and so, too, would be the
fruit-eating quadrupeds if they could get at them. But the thorny
trunk renders them quite inaccessible to all creatures without wings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
excepting man himself. No; there is one other exception, and that
is a creature closely allied to man, I mean the <i>monkey</i>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the thorny stem, which even man cannot scale
without a contrivance; notwithstanding the apparently inaccessible
clusters&mdash;inaccessible from their great height&mdash;there is a species of
monkey that manages now and then to get a meal of them. How do
these monkeys manage it? Not by climbing the stem, for the thorns
are too sharp even for them. How then? Do the nuts fall to the
ground and allow the monkeys to gather them? No. This is not the
case. How then? We shall see!</p>

<p>Guapo and Leon had returned to the camp, taking with them the
pupunha fruit and the firewood. A fire was kindled, the cooking-pot
hung over it on a tripod, and they all sat around to wait for its
boiling.</p>

<p>While thus seated, an unusual noise reached their ears coming
from the woods. There were parrots and macaws among the palms
making noise enough, and fluttering about, but it was not these.
The noise that had arrested the attention of our travellers was a
mixture of screaming, and chattering, and howling, and barking,
as if there were fifty sorts of creatures at the making of it. The
bushes, too, were heard &ldquo;switching about,&rdquo; and now and then a dead
branch would crack, as if snapped suddenly. To a stranger in these
woods such a blending of sounds would have appeared very mysterious
and inexplicable. Not so to our party. They knew it was only
a troop of monkeys passing along upon one of their journeys. From
their peculiar cries, Guapo knew what kind of monkeys they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Marimondas</i>,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The marimondas are not true &ldquo;howlers,&rdquo; although they are of the
same tribe as the &ldquo;howling monkeys.&rdquo; They belong to the genus
<i>Ateles</i>, so called because they want the thumb, and are therefore
<i>imperfect</i> or <i>unfinished</i> as regards the hands. But what the ateles
want in hands is supplied by another member&mdash;the tail, and this
they have to all perfection. It is to them a fifth hand, and apparently
more useful than the other four. It assists them very materially in
travelling through the tree-tops. They use it to bring objects
nearer them. They use it to suspend themselves in a state of repose,
and thus suspended, they sleep&mdash;nay more, thus suspended they often
die! Of all the monkey tribe the ateles are those that have most
prehensile power in their tails.</p>

<p>There are several species of them known&mdash;the coaita, the white-faced,
the black cayou, the beelzebub, the chamek, the black-handed,
and the marimonda. The habits of all are very similar, though the
species differ in size and colour.</p>

<p>The marimonda is one of the largest of South American monkeys,
being about three feet standing upon its hind-legs, with a tail of
immense length, thick and strong near the root, and tapering to
a point. On its under side, for the last foot or so from the end,
there is no hair, but a callous skin, and this is the part used for
holding on to the branches. The marimonda is far from being a
handsome monkey. Its long, thin arms and thumbless hands give it
an attenuated appearance, which is not relieved by the immense
disproportioned tail. It is reddish, or of a parched coffee colour, on
the upper part of the body, which becomes blanched on the throat,
belly, and insides of the thighs. Its colour, in fact, is somewhat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
of the hue of the half-blood Indian and Negro,&mdash;hence the marimonda
is known in some parts of Spanish America by the name of &ldquo;mono zambo,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;zambo&rdquo; monkey&mdash;a &ldquo;zambo&rdquo; being the descendant
of Indian and Negro parents.</p>

<p>The noise made by the marimondas which had been heard by our
party seemed to proceed from the bank of the river, some distance
above the promontory; but it was evidently growing louder every
minute, and they judged that the monkeys were approaching.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they appeared in sight, passing along the upper
part of a grove of trees that stood close to the water. Our travellers
had now an excellent view of them, and they sat watching them
with interest. Their mode of progression was extremely curious.
They never came to the ground, but where the branches interlocked
they ran from one to the other with the lightning speed of squirrels,
or, indeed, like birds upon the wing.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the boughs stood far apart. Then the marimonda,
running out as far as the branch would bear him, would
wrap a few inches of his tail around it and spring off into the air.
In the spring he would give himself such an impetus as would cause
the branch to revolve, and his body following this circular motion,
with the long thin arms thrown out in front, he would grasp the first
branch that he could reach. This, of course, would land him on a
new tree, and over that he would soon spring to the next.</p>

<p>Among the troop several females were perceived with their young.
The latter were carried on the backs of the mothers, where they
held on by means of their own little tails, feeling perfectly secure.
Sometimes the mothers would dismount them, and cause them to
swing themselves from branch to branch, going before to show them
the way. This was witnessed repeatedly. In other places, where
the intervening space was too wide for the females with their young
to pass over, the males could be seen bending down a branch of
the opposite tree, so as to bring it nearer, and assist them in crossing.
All these movements were performed amidst a constant
gabble of conversation, and shouting, and chattering, and the noise
of branches springing back to their places.</p>

<p>The grove through which the troop was passing ended just by the
edge of the promontory. The palm-trees succeeded, with some trees
of large size that grew over them.</p>

<p>The marimondas at length reached the margin of the grove, and
then they were all seen to stop, most of them throwing themselves,
heads down, and hanging only by their tails. This is the position in
which they find themselves best prepared for any immediate action;
and it is into this attitude they throw themselves when suddenly
alarmed. They remained so for some minutes; and from the chattering
carried on among them, it was evident that they were engaged in
deliberation. A loud and general scream proclaimed the result; and
all of them, at one and the same instant, dropped down to the ground,
and were seen crossing over among the palm-trees.</p>

<p>They had to pass over a piece of open ground with only some weeds
upon it; but their helplessness on the ground was at once apparent.
They could not place their palms on the surface, but doubled them
up and walked, as it were, on the backs of their hands in the most
awkward manner. Every now and again, they flung out their great
tails, in hopes of grasping something that would help them along;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
and even a large weed was a welcome support to them. On the
ground they were evidently &ldquo;out of their element.&rdquo; In fact, the
<i>ateles</i> rarely descend from the trees, which are their natural
<i>habitat</i>.</p>

<p>At length they reached the palms; and, seated in various attitudes,
looked up at the tempting fruit, all the while chattering away. How
were they to reach it? Not a tree that was not covered with long
needles&mdash;not a bunch of the luscious fruit that was not far above the
height of the tallest marimonda! How were they to get at it?&mdash;that
was the question. It might have been a puzzling question to so
many boys&mdash;to the monkeys it was not; for in less than a score of
seconds they had settled it in their minds how the pupunhas were to
be plucked.</p>

<p>Rising high over the palms grew a large tree, with long out-reaching
branches. It was the &ldquo;zamang&rdquo; tree&mdash;a species of <i>mimosa</i>,
and one of the most beautiful trees of South America. Its trunk
rose full seventy feet without a branch; and then it spread out in
every direction in numerous horizontal limbs, that forked and forked
again until they became slender boughs. These branches were clad
with the delicate pinnate leaves that characterise the family of the
mimosas.</p>

<p>Many of the pupunha palms grew under the shadow of this zamang,
but not the tallest ones. These were farther out. There were some,
however, whose tufted crowns reached within a few yards of the
lower limbs of the mimosa.</p>

<p>The monkeys, after a short consultation, were seen scampering up
the zamang. Only some of the old and strong ones went&mdash;the rest
remained watching below.</p>

<p>From the earnestness of their looks it was evident they felt a lively
interest in the result. So, too, did the party of travellers; for these
watched so closely, that the pot was in danger of boiling over.</p>

<p>The marimondas, having climbed the trunk, ran out upon the
lowermost limbs, until they were directly above the palms. Then
one or two were seen to drop off, and hang down by their tails. But,
although, with their fore-arms at full stretch, they hung nearly five
feet from the branch, they could not even touch the highest fronds
of the palms, much less the fruit-clusters that were ten or twelve feet
farther down. They made repeated attempts; suspending themselves
over the very tallest palms, but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>One would have supposed they would have given it up as a bad
job. So thought Do&ntilde;a Isidora, Leon, and the little Leona. Don
Pablo knew better by his reading, and Guapo by his experience.
When they saw that no one of them could reach the nuts, several
were seen to get together on one of the branches. After a moment
one dropped down head-foremost as before, and hung at his full
length. Another ran down the body of this one, and taking a turn
of his tail round his neck and fore-arm, skipped off and also hung
head downwards. A third joined himself on to the second in a
similar manner, and then a fourth. The fore-arms of the fourth
rested upon the fruit-cluster of the pupunha!</p>

<p>The chain was now long enough for the purpose. In a few minutes
the last monkey on the chain, with his teeth and hands, had separated
the footstalk of the spathes, and the great clusters&mdash;two of them
there were&mdash;fell heavily to the bottom of the tree. The marimondas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
on the ground ran forward; and, in the midst of loud rejoicings
began to pull off the &ldquo;peaches&rdquo; and devour them.</p>

<p>But the monkeys above did not cease their labours. There were many
mouths to feed, and they wanted more nuts. Without changing
their position, they, by means of their arms and legs, threw
themselves into a vibrating motion, and by this means the last on
the string soon seized upon another pupunha, and also detached its
fruit. In this way they continued, until they had stripped every
tree within their reach; when, judging they had got enough, the
lowermost monkey <i>climbed back upon himself</i>, then up his companions
to the branch, and in the same style was followed by the other three
in succession. As soon as they were clear of one another, the whole
party came down by the trunk to the ground, and joined their comrades
below in the luxurious repast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE MONKEY MOTHER.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">N</span>ow you will, perhaps, imagine that Guapo, having sat so quiet
during all this scene, had no desire for a bit of roast-monkey to
supper. In that fancy, then, you would be quite astray from the
truth. Guapo had a <i>strong</i> desire to eat roast marimonda that very
night; and, had he not been held back by Don Pablo, he would
never have allowed the monkeys to get quietly out of the zamang&mdash;for
it being an isolated tree, it would have afforded him a capital
opportunity of &ldquo;treeing&rdquo; them. His blow-gun had been causing his
fingers to itch all the time; and as soon as Don Pablo and the rest
were satisfied with observing the monkeys, Guapo set out, blow-gun,
in hand, followed by Leon.</p>

<p>There was no cover by which he might approach the group; and,
therefore, no course was left for him but to run up as quickly forward
as possible, and take his chance of getting a shot as they made off.</p>

<p>This course he pursued; but, before he was within anything like
fair range, the monkeys, uttering their shrill screams, scampered
over the open ground, much faster than before, and took to the
grove, from which they had approached the spot.</p>

<p>Guapo followed at a slashing pace, and was soon under the trees,
Leon at his heels. Here they were met by a shower of sticks, pieces
of bark, half-eaten &ldquo;peaches,&rdquo; and something that was far less
pleasant to their olfactory nerves! All these came from the tops of
the trees&mdash;the very tallest ones&mdash;to which the monkeys had retreated,
and where they were now hidden among the llianas and
leaves.</p>

<p>You may fancy that it is easy to pursue a troop of monkeys in a
forest. But it is not easy&mdash;in most cases it is not <i>possible</i>. The
tangled underwood below puts a stop to the chase at once, as the
monkeys can make their way through the branches above much
quicker than the hunter can through the creeping plants below.</p>

<p>The pursuit would have been all up with Guapo, for the marimondas
had soon got some way beyond the edge of the grove; but
just as he was turning to sulk back, his keen Indian eye caught sight
of one that was far behind the rest&mdash;so far, indeed, that it seemed
determined to seek its safety rather by hiding than by flight. It had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
got under cover of a bunch of leaves, and there it lay quiet, uttering
neither sound nor syllable. Guapo could just see a little bit of its
side, and at this in an instant the gravat&aacute;na was pointed. Guapo's
chest and cheeks were seen to swell out to their fullest extent, and
off went the arrow. A shriek followed&mdash;the monkey was hit&mdash;beyond
a doubt. Guapo coolly waited the result.</p>

<p>A movement was visible among the leaves; the marimonda was
seen to turn and double about, and pluck something from its side;
and then the broken arrow came glancing among the twigs, and fell
to the ground. The monkey was now perceived to be twisting and
writhing upon the branches, and its wild death-screams was answered
by the voices of the others farther off.</p>

<p>At length its body was seen more distinctly; it no longer thought of
concealment; but lay out along the limb; and the next moment it
dropped off. It did not fall to the ground, though. It had no design
of gratifying its cruel destroyer to that extent. No; it merely
dropped to the end of its tail, which, lapped over the branch, held it
suspended. A few convulsive vibrations followed, and it hung down
dead!</p>

<p>Guapo was thinking in what way he might get it down, for he
knew that unless he could reach it by some means, it would hang
there until the weather rotted it off, or until some preying bird or
the tree-ants had eaten it. He thought of his axe&mdash;the tree was not
a very thick one, and it was a soft-wood tree. It would be worth the
labour of cutting it down.</p>

<p>He was about turning away to get the axe, when his eye was
attracted by the motion of some object near the monkey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another!&rdquo; he muttered, and sure enough, another,&mdash;a little tiny-creature,&mdash;ran
out from among the leaves, and climbed down the tail
and body of the one already shot, threw it arms around her neck and
whined piteously. It was the young one&mdash;Guapo had shot the
mother!</p>

<p>The sight filled Leon with pity and grief; but Guapo knew nothing
of these sentiments. He had already inserted another arrow into his
gravat&aacute;na, and was raising his tube to bend it, when, all at once,
there was a loud rustling among the leaves above&mdash;a large marimonda
that had returned from the band was seen springing out upon the
branch&mdash;he was the husband and father!</p>

<p>He did not pause a moment. Instinct or quick perception taught
him that the female was dead: his object was to save the young one.</p>

<p>He threw his long tail down, and grasped the little creature in its
firm hold, jerked it upward; and then mounting it on his back, bore
it off among the branches!</p>

<p>All this passed so quickly, that Guapo had not time to deliver his
second arrow. Guapo saw them no more.</p>

<p>The Indian, however, was not to be cheated out of his supper of
roasted-monkey. He walked quietly back for his axe; and bringing
it up, soon felled the tree, and took the marimond mother with him
to the camp.</p>

<p>His next affair was to skin it, which he did by stripping the pelt
from the head, arms, legs, and all; so that after being skinned, the
creature bore a most hideous resemblance to a child!</p>

<p>The process of cooking came next, and this Guapo made more
tedious than it might have been, as he was resolved to dress the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
marimonda after the manner practised by the Indians, and which by
them is esteemed the best. He first built a little stage out of split
laths of the pupunha palm. For this a hard wood that will resist
fire a long time is necessary, and the pupunha was just the thing.</p>

<p>Under this stage Guapo kindled a fire of dry wood, and upon the
laths he placed his monkey in a sitting posture, with its arms crossed
in front, and its head resting upon them. The fire was then blown
upon, until it became a bright blaze, which completely enveloped the
half-upright form of the monkey. There was plenty of smoke; but
this is nothing in the eyes of a South American Indian, many of
whom prefer the &ldquo;smoky flavour&rdquo; in a roast monkey.</p>

<p>Guapo had now no more to do, but wait patiently until the body
should be reduced to a black and charred mass, for this is the condition
in which it is eaten by these strange people. When thus
cooked, the flesh becomes so dry that it will keep for months without
spoiling.</p>

<p>The white people who live in the <i>monkey countries</i> eat roast monkey
as well as the Indians. Many of them, in fact, grow very fond of it.
They usually dress it, however, in a different manner. They take off
the head and hands before bringing it to the table; so that the
&ldquo;child-like&rdquo; appearance is less perceptible.</p>

<p>Some species of monkeys are more delicate food than others, and
there are some kinds that <i>white</i> monkey-eaters will not touch.</p>

<p>As for the Indians, it seems with them to be &ldquo;all fish,&rdquo; &amp;c.; and
they devour all kinds indifferently, whether they be &ldquo;howlers,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ateles,&rdquo; or &ldquo;capuchins,&rdquo; or &ldquo;ouistitis,&rdquo; or &ldquo;sajous,&rdquo; or &ldquo;sakis,&rdquo; or
whatever sort. In fact, among many Indian tribes, monkey stands
in the same place that mutton does in England; and they consider
it their staple article of flesh meat. Indeed, in these parts, no other
animal is so common as the monkey; and, with the exception of
birds and fish, they have little chance of getting any other species of
animal food. The best &ldquo;Southdown&rdquo; would, perhaps, be as distasteful
to them as monkey meat would be to you; so here again we are
met by that same eternal proverb,&mdash;<i>Chacun &agrave; son go&ucirc;t</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<div class="cap">AN UNEXPECTED GUEST.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">G</span>uapo sat by the fire patiently awaiting the &ldquo;doing&rdquo; of the marimonda.
The rest had eaten their supper, and were seated some
distance apart. They were looking out upon the broad river, and
watching the movements of the various birds. They could see tall
scarlet flamingoes on the farther shore, and smaller birds of the ibis
kind. They could see the &ldquo;tiger crane,&rdquo; so called from its colour and
spots resembling the markings of the jaguar. Among some tall
canes on the banks the &ldquo;ciganos,&rdquo; or gipsy birds, fluttered about with
their great crest, looking like so many pheasants, but far inferior to
these creatures in their flesh. In fact, the flesh of the &ldquo;cigano&rdquo; is so
bitter and disagreeable that even <i>Indians will not eat it</i>.</p>

<p>Sitting upon a naked branch that projected over the water they
noticed the solitary sky-blue king-fisher. Over the water swept the
great harpy eagle&mdash;also a fisher like his white-headed cousin of the
North; and now and then flocks of muscovy ducks made the air<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
resound with their strong broad wings. They saw also the &ldquo;boat-bill,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;crab-eater,&rdquo; a curious wading bird of the heron kind, with
a large bill shaped like two boats laid with their concave sides
against each other. This, like the king-fisher, sat solitarily upon a
projecting stump, now and then dashing into the shallow water, and
scooping up the small fishes, frogs, and crustacea with its huge
mandibles.</p>

<p>Another curious bird was observed, which had something of the
appearance of the water-hen&mdash;to which kind it is also assimilated in
its habits. It was the &ldquo;faithful jacana&rdquo; or &ldquo;chuza,&rdquo; as it is called in
some places. There are several species of &ldquo;jacana&rdquo; in South America,
and also some species in the tropical countries of the East. That
known as the &ldquo;faithful jacana&rdquo; has a body about the size of a
common fowl; but its legs and neck are longer, so that when standing
it is a foot and a half in height. The body is of a brownish colour;
and there is a crest of twelve black feathers on the nape of the
neck, three inches in length. At the bend of the wings there are
horny spurs, half an inch long, with which the bird can defend itself
when attacked. It is, however, a pacific bird, and only uses them in
defence.</p>

<p>The most singular character of the jacana is its long toes and
claws. There are four upon each foot: three in front, and one
directed backwards, and when standing these cover a base nearly as
large as the body of the bird; and, indeed, upon ordinary ground
they interfere with the freedom of its walking. But these spreading
feet were not designed for ordinary ground. They were given it to
enable it to pass lightly over the leaves of water-lilies, and other
yielding surfaces, through which a narrow-footed bird would at once
sink. Of course, as nature designed them for this purpose, they
answer admirably, and the jacana skims along the surface of lily-covered
ponds or streams without sinking. From the leaves it picks
up such insects and larv&aelig; as lodge there, and which form its principal
food.</p>

<p>The jacana utters a singular cry when alarmed. It remains silent
during the whole day, and also at night, unless disturbed by the approach
of some danger, when it utters its &ldquo;alarm cry.&rdquo; So quick is
its ear, that it can detect the least noise or rustling caused by any
one approaching. For this reason some tribes of Indians have tamed
the jacana, and use it as a sentinel or &ldquo;watch-dog,&rdquo; to apprise them
of the approach of their enemies during the darkness of the night.
Another use is also made of it by the Spanish-Americans. It is
tamed and allowed to go about along with the domestic poultry.
When these are attacked by hawks or other birds of prey, the jacana
defends them with its sharp wing-spurs, and generally succeeds in
beating off the enemy. It never deserts the flock, but accompanies
it in all its movements, and will defend its charge with great fury
and courage.</p>

<p>Besides the water-birds which were noticed by our travellers, many
kinds were seen by them upon the shore and fluttering among the
trees. There were parrots in flocks, and macaws in pairs&mdash;for these
birds usually go in twos&mdash;there were trogons, and great billed toucans,
and their kindred the aracaris; and there, too, were &ldquo;umbrella-chatterers,&rdquo;
of which there is a species quite white; and upon a
fruit-covered tree, not far off, they saw a flock of the snow-white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
&ldquo;bell-birds&rdquo; (<i>Casmarhynchos</i>). These are about as large as blackbirds,
with broad bills, from the base of which grows a fleshy tubercle
that hangs down to the length of nearly three inches, like that of the
turkey-cock. The name of &ldquo;bell-birds&rdquo; is given to them on account
of the clear, bell-like ring of their note, which they utter about the
middle of the day, when most other creatures of the tropical world
are in silence or asleep.</p>

<p>Of course Don Pablo as a naturalist was interested in all those
birds, and observed their habits and movements with attention.
There was none of them about which he had not some strange story
to tell, and in this way he was beguiling the after-supper hour. It
was too early for them to go to rest&mdash;indeed it was not quite sunset;
and Guapo for one had not yet had his supper, although that meal
was now very near at hand. The marimonda was becoming charred
and black, and would soon be ready for mastication.</p>

<p>Guapo sat by the fire, now and again raking up the cinders with a
long pole which he held in his hand, while his eyes from time to time
rested on the marimonda that was directly in front of him, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>.</p>

<p>At length the monkey appeared to him to be &ldquo;done to a turn,&rdquo; and
with his <i>machet&eacute;</i> in one hand, and a forked stick in the other, he was
just bending forward to lift it off the fire, when, to his horror, the
ground was felt to move beneath him, causing him to stagger, and
almost throwing him from his feet! Before he could recover himself,
the surface again heaved up, and a loud report was heard, like the
explosion of some terrible engine. Then another upheaval&mdash;another
report&mdash;the ground opened into a long fissure&mdash;the staging of palms,
and the half-burned cinders, and the charred monkey, were flung in
all directions, and Guapo himself went sprawling upon his back!</p>

<p>Was it an earthquake? So thought the others, who were now on
their feet running about in great consternation&mdash;the females screaming
loudly. So, too, thought Guapo for the moment.</p>

<p>Their belief in its being an earthquake, however, was of short
duration. The shocks continued; the dried mud flew about in large
pieces, and the burnt wood and splinters were showered in the air.
The smoke of these covered the spot, and prevented a clear view; but
through the smoke the terrified spectators could perceive that some
large body was in motion&mdash;apparently struggling for life! In another
moment it broke through the bending stratum of mud, causing a long
rift, and there was displayed before their eyes the hideous form of a
gigantic crocodile!</p>

<p>Though not quite so terrible as an earthquake, it was a fearful
monster to behold. It was one of the largest, being nearly twenty
feet in length, with a body thicker than that of a man. Its immense
jaws were of themselves several feet long, and its huge tusks, plainly
seen, gave it a most frightful appearance. Its mouth was thrown
open, as though it gasped for air, and a loud bellowing proceeded
from its throat that sounded like a cross between the grunting of a
hog and the lowing of a bull.</p>

<p>The air was filled with a strong musky odour, which emanated from
the body of the animal; and, what with the noise made by the
crocodile itself, the screams and shouts of the party, the yelling of the
various birds&mdash;for they, too, had taken up the cue&mdash;there was for
some moments an utter impossibility of any voice being heard above
the rest. It was, indeed, a scene of confusion. Don Pablo and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
companions were running to and fro&mdash;Guapo was tumbling about
where he had fallen&mdash;and the great lizard was writhing and flapping
his tail, so that pots, pans, half-burnt faggots, and even Guapo's
monkey, were being knocked about in every direction.</p>

<p>Of course such a violent scene could not be of long duration. It
must end one way or the other. Guapo, who soon came to himself,
now that he saw what it was that had pitched him over, had already
conceived a plan for terminating it. He ran for his axe, which
fortunately lay out of the range of the crocodile's tail, and having
laid his hands upon it, he approached in a stealthy manner with the
intention of striking a blow.</p>

<p>He directed himself towards the root of the reptile's tail, for he
knew that that was the only place where a blow of the axe would
cripple it; but, just as he was getting within reach, the crocodile
suddenly shifted himself round, making his tail fly like a piece of
sprung whalebone. Guapo leaped hastily back&mdash;as hastily, I will
make bold to say, as any Indian of his years could have done, but not
quick enough to clear himself quite. He wanted about eight inches;
but in this case inches were as good as miles for the crocodile's purpose,
for about eight inches of the tip of his tail came &ldquo;smack&rdquo; across
Guapo's naked shins, and sent the old Indian head over heels.</p>

<p>It was just an accident that Guapo's shanks were not broken like
sticks of sealing-wax; and had the blow been directed with the
crocodile's full force, such would have been the unhappy result. As
it was they were only &ldquo;scratched,&rdquo; and Guapo, leaping to his feet,
ran to recover his axe, for that weapon had flown several yards out of
his hands at the blow.</p>

<p>By the time he laid hold of it, however, the <i>saurian</i>, was no longer
on dry ground. His newly-opened eyes&mdash;opened, perhaps, for the
first time for months&mdash;caught sight of the water close by, and crawling
forward a step or two, he launched his ugly, mud-bedaubed carcass
into the welcome element. The next moment he had dived, and was
out of sight.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE CROCODILE AND CAPIVARAS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">G</span>uapo was in no humour for enjoying the conversation of that evening.
The crocodile had &ldquo;choused&rdquo; him out of his favourite supper.
The monkey was literally knocked to &ldquo;smithereens,&rdquo; and the pieces
that still adhered together were daubed all over with mud. It wasn't
fit meat&mdash;even for an Indian&mdash;and Guapo had to content himself with
a dried plantain and a stew of jerked horse-flesh.</p>

<p>Of course Don Pablo and the rest examined with curiosity the great
hole in the mud that had contained the crocodile. There it had lain
during months of the dry season in a state of torpidity, and would,
no doubt, have remained still longer, but that it was aroused by the
big fire that Guapo had built over it. The irritation produced by this
had been the cause of its sudden resurrection, for the crocodiles that
thus bury themselves usually come out after the beginning of the
heavy rains.</p>

<p>It was a true long-snouted crocodile, as Don Pablo had observed in
the short opportunity he had had; and not an alligator&mdash;for it must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
be here remarked, that the true crocodile is found in many parts of
Spanish America, and also in many of the West Indian Islands. For
a long time it was believed that only alligators existed in America,
and that the crocodiles were confined to the Eastern Continent. It
is now known that at least one species of crocodile is an American
animal, and several distinct species of alligators are inhabitants of
the New World.</p>

<p>There is the alligator of the Mississippi&mdash;which is the &ldquo;ca&iuml;man&rdquo; or
&ldquo;cayman&rdquo; of the Spanish Americans; there is the spectacled alligator,
a southern species, so called from a pair of rings around its
eyes having a resemblance to spectacles; and there is a still smaller
species called the &ldquo;bava,&rdquo; which is found in Lake Valencia, and in
many South American rivers. The last kind is much hunted by the
Indians, who, although they eat parts of all these creatures, are fonder
of the flesh of the bava than of any of the others.</p>

<p>They had not intended to keep watch this night, as the naked
promontory seemed to be a safe place to sleep upon; but now, after
their adventure with the crocodile, they changed their minds, and
they resolved to mount guard as before. The monster might easily
crawl out of the water again, and, judging from the size of his
mouth, it is not improbable to suppose that he might have swallowed
one of the smaller individuals of the party at a single effort. Lest
he might return to use either his teeth or his tail, the watch was
set as on other nights&mdash;Leon taking the first turn, Guapo the second,
and Don Pablo sitting it out till daybreak. The night passed
through, however, without any unusual disturbance; and although
an occasional plunge was heard in the water close by, no more was
seen of the crocodile until morning.</p>

<p>I have said <i>until</i> morning&mdash;for he was seen then. Yes! indeed.
That beauty was not going to let them off without giving them
another peep at him&mdash;not he.</p>

<p>They were awake and up before day; and as the fire had been kept
burning all night, they had now nothing more to do than rake up
the embers, and hang on the coffee-kettle. It was not yet bright
day when breakfast was already cooked, and they sat down to eat
it.</p>

<p>While engaged in this operation, they noticed a string of flamingoes
on the muddy promontory, at the end where it joined the land.
They were ranged in line, like soldiers, some of them balanced on one
long thin leg, as these birds do. They appeared in the grey light to be
unusually tall; but when it became a little clearer, our travellers
could perceive that they were not upon the ground, but standing
upon an old log. This, of course, made them look taller. They
were just in the very track by which Guapo and Leon had passed to
get the wood the evening before. Now, neither Guapo nor Leon
remembered any log. They were certain there was none there, else
they would have cut it up for firewood, that was a sure thing; and
it was very mysterious who could have rolled a log there during the
night!</p>

<p>While discussing this point it became clearer; and, to the astonishment
of all, what they had taken to be an old log turned out to be
nothing else than their old friend the crocodile! I have said to the
astonishment of all&mdash;that is not strictly correct. Guapo saw nothing
to astonish him in that sight. He had witnessed a similar one many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
a time, and so does every one who travels either on the Amazon or
the Orinoco.</p>

<p>These flamingoes were perfectly safe, so far as the crocodile was
concerned, and they knew it. As long as they kept out of the reach
of his jaws and tail, he could not hurt them. Although he could
bend himself to either side, so as to &ldquo;kiss&rdquo; the tip of his own tail, he
could not reach any part of his back, exert himself as he might. This
the flamingoes and other birds well know, and these creatures being
fond of a place to perch upon, often avail themselves of the long
serrated back of the crocodile, or the ca&iuml;man.</p>

<p>As the day became brighter the flamingoes sat still&mdash;not appearing
to be alarmed by the movements at the camp, which was about an
hundred yards distant from their perch. It was likely they had
never been frightened by the hunter, for these birds in districts
where they are hunted are exceedingly shy. All at once, however,
as if by a given signal, the whole flock rose together, and flew off
with loud screams. The crocodile, too, was seen to move, but it was
not this which had scared them off. It was after they had gone that
he had stirred himself; and even, had it not been so, they would not
have regarded his movements, as these birds are often seen perched
upon a <i>crawling</i> crocodile!</p>

<p>No. Something else had affrighted them, and that was a noise in
the bushes beyond, which was now distinctly heard at the camp.
There was a rustling of leaves and a crackling of branches, as if more
than one creature made the noise. So it appeared, for the next
moment nearly a score of animals dashed out of the bushes, and ran
on towards the water.</p>

<p>These creatures were odd enough to fix the attention of the party
at the camp. They were about the size of small hogs&mdash;very much of
the same build&mdash;and covered with a thin sandy bristly hair, just like
some hogs are. They were not &ldquo;pig-headed,&rdquo; however. Their heads
were exactly like those of the grey rabbit, and instead of hoofs they
were toed and clawed. This gave them altogether a lighter appearance
than hogs, and yet they did not run as fast, although when
first noticed they appeared to be doing their best.</p>

<p>Our travellers knew them at once, for they were animals that are
common upon the rivers in all the warm parts of South America.
They were &ldquo;<i>capivaras</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;chiguires,&rdquo; as they are also called. These
creatures are peculiar to the American continent. They are, in fact,
&ldquo;guinea-pigs&rdquo; on a large scale, and bear the greatest resemblance
to those well-known animals, except in size and colour; for the
capivaras are of uniform sandy brown.</p>

<p>They are of the same genus as the guinea-pigs, though the systematizers
have put them into a separate one, and have also made a
third genus to suit another animal of very similar shape and habits.
This is the &ldquo;moco,&rdquo; which is between the guinea-pig and capivara in
size, and of a greyish olive colour. All three are natives of South
America, and in their wild state are found only there, though from
the absurd name &ldquo;guinea-pig,&rdquo; you may be led to think that this
little creature came originally from Africa.</p>

<p>The three are all &ldquo;rodent&rdquo; animals, and the capivara is the largest
&ldquo;rodent&rdquo; that is known. It, moreover, is amphibious, quite as much
so as the tapir, and is found only near the banks of rivers. It is
more at home in the water than on dry land, or perhaps it has more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
numerous enemies on land; though, poor, persecuted creature! it is
not without some in either element, as will be seen by what follows.</p>

<p>The drove of the capivaras counted nearly a score, and they were
making for the water as fast as their legs could carry them. The
crocodile lay directly across their path, but their black eyes, large
and prominent, seemed to be occupied with something behind; and
they had run up almost against the body of the reptile before they
saw it. Uttering a sort of squeak they made a half-pause. Some
sprang up and leaped over&mdash;others attempted to go round. All
succeeded except one; but the crocodile, on seeing their approach&mdash;no
doubt it was for this he had been in wait all the morning&mdash;had
thrown himself into the form of a half-moon; and as they passed
he let fly at them. His powerful tail came &ldquo;flap&rdquo; against the
nearest, and it was pitched several yards, where, after a kick or two,
it lay upon its side as dead as a herring, a door-nail, or even Julius
C&aelig;sar&mdash;take your choice.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<div class="cap">FIGHT OF THE JAGUAR AND CROCODILE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he chiguires that escaped past the crocodile, the next instant
plunged into the river, and disappeared under the water. They
would come to the surface for breath in ten or twelve minutes, but
at such a distance off that they needed no longer fear pursuit from
the same enemy.</p>

<p>Our travellers took no notice of them from the moment they were
fairly out of the bushes. They saw that the crocodile had knocked
one of them over; but the eyes of Guapo and Don Pablo were
directed upon a different place&mdash;the point at which the chiguires had
sallied out of the underwood. These knew that the animals had
not issued forth in their natural way, as if they were going to the
stream to drink, or in search of food. No&mdash;quite different. Their
bristles were erect&mdash;they were excited&mdash;they were terrified&mdash;beyond
a doubt they were pursued!</p>

<p>Who or what was their pursuer? It might be an ocelot, or the
yaguarundi, or some one of the smaller cats; for many of these prey
on the defenceless capivara. It <i>might</i> be one of these, thought Don
Pablo and Guapo; but what if it was not? What else could it be?
What else? <i>The jaguar!</i></p>

<p>It <i>was</i> the jaguar? As they stood gazing with looks full of
apprehension, the leaves of the underwood were seen to move, and
then a beautiful but terrible object, the spotted head of a jaguar,
was thrust forth. It remained a moment as if reconnoitring, and
then the whole body, bright and glistening, glided clear of the
leaves, and stood boldly out in front of the underwood. Here it
halted another moment&mdash;only a moment. The crocodile had turned
itself, and was about closing its jaws upon the body of the chiguire,
when the jaguar seeing this, uttered a loud scream, and making one
bound forward, seized the dead animal almost at the same instant.</p>

<p>They were now face to face,&mdash;the great lizard and the great cat;
and their common prey was between them. Each had a firm hold
with his powerful jaws, and each appeared determined to keep
what he had got. The yellow eyes of the jaguar seemed to flash fire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
and the black sunken orbs of the saurian glared with a lurid and
deadly light. It was a terrible picture to look upon.</p>

<p>For some seconds both remained apparently gazing into each
other's eyes, and firmly holding the prey between them. The tail
of the jaguar vibrated in sudden angry jerks, while that of the
crocodile lay bent into a semicircle, as if ready to be sprung at
a moment's notice.</p>

<p>This inaction did not last long. The fury of the jaguar was
evidently on the increase. He was indignant that he, the king of
the American forest, should thus meet with opposition to his will;
and, indeed, the crocodile was about the only creature in all the
wide Monta&ntilde;a that dare oppose him in open fight. But he was
determined to conquer even this enemy, and for that purpose he
prepared himself.</p>

<p>Still holding on to the capivara, and watching his opportunity,
he sprang suddenly forward, throwing one of his great paws far in
advance. His object was to <i>claw the eye</i> of his adversary; for he
well knew that the latter was vulnerable neither upon its long
snout, nor its gaunt jaws, nor even upon the tough scaly skin of its
throat. Its eyes alone could be injured, and these were the objects
of the jaguar's attack.</p>

<p>The thrust was a failure. The crocodile had anticipated such
a man&#339;uvre, and suddenly raising himself on his fore-legs, threw up
one of his great scaly hands and warded off the blow. The jaguar
fearing to be clutched between the strong fore-arms of the saurian,
drew back to his former position.</p>

<p>This man&#339;uvre, and its counter-man&#339;uvre, were repeated several
times, and although each time the struggle lasted a little longer
than before, and there was a good deal of lashing of tails and tearing
of teeth, and scratching of claws, still neither of the combatants
seemed to gain any great advantage. Both were now at the height
of their fury, and a third enemy approaching the spot would not
have been heeded by either.</p>

<p>From the first the head of the crocodile had been turned to the
water, from which he was not distant over ten feet. He had, in fact,
been carrying his prey towards it when he was interrupted by the
attack of the jaguar; and now at every fresh opportunity he was
pushing on, bit by bit, in that direction. He knew that in his own
proper element he would be more than a match for his spotted
assailant, and no doubt he might have escaped from the contest by
surrendering his prey. Had he been a smaller crocodile he would
have been only too glad to have done so; but trusting to his size
and strength, and perhaps not a little to the justice of his cause, he
was determined not to go without taking the capivara along with
him.</p>

<p>The jaguar, on the other hand, was just as determined he should
not. He, too, had some rights. The capivara would not have been
killed so easily, had he not frightened it from behind; besides, the
crocodile was out of his element. He was poaching on the domain
of the forest monarch.</p>

<p>Bit by bit, the crocodile was gaining ground&mdash;at each fresh pause
in the struggle he was forging forward, pushing the chiguire before
him, and of course causing his antagonist to make ground backwards.</p>

<p>The jaguar at length felt his hind-feet in the water; and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
seemed to act upon him like a shock of electricity. All at once he
let go his hold of the capivara, ran a few feet forward, and then
flattening his body along the ground, prepared himself for a mighty
spring. Before a second had passed, he launched his body high into
the air, and descended upon the back of the crocodile just over his
fore-shoulders! He did not settle there, but ran nimbly down the
back of the saurian towards its hinder part, and its claws could
be heard rattling against its scaly skin.</p>

<p>In a moment more he was seen close-squatted along the crocodile's
body, and with his teeth tearing fiercely at the root of its tail. He
knew that after the eyes this was the most vulnerable part of his
antagonist, and if he had been allowed but a few minutes' time, he
would soon have disabled the crocodile; for to have seriously
wounded the root of his tail, would have been to have destroyed his
essential weapon of offence.</p>

<p>The jaguar would have succeeded had the encounter occurred only
a dozen yards farther from the water. But the crocodile was close
to the river's edge, and perceiving the advantage against him, and
that there was no hope of dismounting his adversary, he dropped
the capivara, and crawling forward, plunged into the water. When
fairly launched, he shot out from the shore like an arrow, carrying
the jaguar along, and the next moment he had dived to the depth of
the stream. The water was lashed into foam by the blows of his feet
and tail; but in the midst of the froth, the yellow body of the jaguar
was seen rising to the surface, and after turning once or twice, as if
searching for his hated enemy, the creature headed for the bank and
climbed out. He stood for a moment looking back into the stream.
He appeared less cowed than angry and disappointed. He seemed
to vow a future revenge; and then seizing the half-torn carcass of
the capivara, he threw it lightly over his shoulder and trotted off
into the thicket.</p>

<p>Our travellers had not watched this scene either closely or continuously.
They had been too busy all the time. From its commencement
they had been doing all in their power to get away from
the spot; for they dreaded lest the jaguar might either first overpower
the crocodile and then attack them, or being beaten off by
the latter, might take it into his head to revenge himself by killing
whatever he could. With these apprehensions, therefore, they had
hastily carried everything aboard, and drawing in their cable, pushed
the balza from the shore. When the fight came to an end, they had
got fairly into the current, and just as the jaguar disappeared, the
raft was gliding swiftly down the broad and rippling stream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<div class="cap">ADVENTURE WITH AN ANACONDA.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">F</span>or several days they voyaged down-stream, without any occurrence
of particular interest. Once or twice they saw Indians upon the
shore; but these, instead of putting off in their canoes, seemed
frightened at so large a craft, and remained by their &ldquo;maloccas,&rdquo; or
great village-houses, in each of which several families live together.
Not caring to have any dealings with them, our travellers were only
too glad to get past without molestation; and, therefore, when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
passed any place where they thought they observed the signs of
Indians on the bank, they kept on for hours after, without stopping.</p>

<p>A curious incident occurred one evening as they were bringing the
balza to her moorings, which compelled them to drop a little farther
down-stream, and, in fact, almost obliged them to float all night,
which would have been a dangerous matter, as the current at the
place happened to be sharp and rapid.</p>

<p>They had been on the look-out for some time for a good camping-place,
as it was their usual hour to stop. No opening, however, appeared
for several miles. The banks on both sides were thickly-wooded
to the river's edge, and the branches of the trees even
drooped into the water. At length they came in sight of a natural
raft that had been formed by driftwood in a bend of the stream;
and as the logs lay thickly together, and even piled upon each other,
it appeared an excellent place to encamp on. It was, at all events,
better than to attempt to penetrate the thick jungles which met
them everywhere else; and so the balza was directed towards the
raft, and soon floated alongside it.</p>

<p>They had already got ashore on the raft, which was dry and firm,
and would have served their purpose well enough; when, all at
once, Guapo was heard uttering one of those exclamations, which
showed that all was not right. The rest looked towards him for
an explanation. He was standing by the edge of the floating
timber, just where the balza touched it, with his arms stretched out
in an attitude that betokened trouble. They all ran up. They saw
what was the matter at a glance. Thousands of red ants were
climbing from the raft to the balza! Thousands,&mdash;nay, it would be
nearer the truth to say millions!</p>

<p>At one glance Don Pablo saw that it would be a terrible calamity,
should these creatures gain a lodgment on the balza. Not only were
they the dreaded stinging ants, but in a short time nothing on board
would be left. In a few hours they would have eaten all his stores,&mdash;his
bark, his vanilla, and his roots. Already quite a number had got
upon the canoe, and were crossing it toward the body of the balza.</p>

<p>Without saying another word, he ordered all to get on board as
quickly as possible, each taking some utensil that had already been
carried on shore. He and Guapo flew to the poles; and, having
hastily unfastened and drawn in the cable, they pushed the balza
out into the stream. Then while Guapo managed the great oar, Don
Pablo, assisted by Leon and by Do&ntilde;a Isidora, went to work with
scoops and pails, dashing water upon the ants; until every one of
them had disappeared, drowned in the canoe or washed off into the
river. Fortunate for them, they had observed this strange enemy
in time. Had they not done so&mdash;in other words, had they gone to
sleep, leaving the balza where it was during the night&mdash;they would
have awakened in the morning to find their stores completely destroyed,
their labour of a year brought to nothing in the space of a
single night. This is no uncommon occurrence to the merchant or
the colonist of tropical America.</p>

<p>They had made a narrow escape, but a fortunate one. They were
not without their troubles, however. No open ground could be found
for miles below; and, as it was growing dark, they approached the
thickly-wooded bank; and, after a good deal of scratching among
the branches, at length succeeded in making the cable fast to a tree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
The balza then swung round, and floated at the end of the cable,
half of it being buried under the long hanging branches.</p>

<p>They spent their night on board, for it was no use attempting to
to get on shore through the underwood; and even if they had, they
could not have encamped very comfortably in a thicket. On the
other hand, the balza did not afford the best accommodation for
sleeping. The little &ldquo;toldo,&rdquo; or cabin, was not large enough to swing
a hammock in. It would only contain a few persons seated close together;
and it had been built more for the purpose of keeping the
sun off during the hot hours of the day than for sleeping in. The
rest of the balza was occupied with the freight; and this was so
arranged with sloping sides, thatched with the bussu-leaves, that
there was no level place where one could repose upon it. The night,
therefore, was passed without very much sleep having been obtained
by any one of the party. Of course, the moment the first streaks of
day began to appear along the Eastern sky, they were all awake and
ready to leave their disagreeable anchorage.</p>

<p>As they were making preparations to untie the cable, they noticed
that just below where the balza lay, a horizontal limb stretched far
out over the river. It was the lowermost limb of a large zamang-tree,
that stood on the bank close to the edge of the water. It was
not near the surface, but a good many feet above. Still it was not
certain that it was high enough for the roof of the toldo to clear it.
That was an important question; for although the current was not
very rapid just there, it was sufficiently so to carry the balza under
this branch before they could push it out into the stream. Once the
cable was let go, they must inevitably pass under the limb of the
zamang; and if that caught the toldo, it would sweep off the frail
roof like so much spider's-web. This would be a serious damage;
and one to be avoided, if possible.</p>

<p>Don Pablo and Guapo went to the end of the balza nearest the
branch, and stood for some time surveying it. It was about eight or
ten yards distant; but in the gray dawn they could not judge
correctly of its height, and they waited till it grew a little clearer.
At length they came to the conclusion that the branch was high
enough. The long pendulous leaves&mdash;characteristic of this great
<i>mimosa</i> and the drooping branchlets hung down much below the
main shaft; but these, even if they touched the roof, would do no
injury. It was, therefore, determined to let go the cable.</p>

<p>It was now clear day, for they had been delayed a good while; but
at length all was ready, and Guapo untied the cable, and drew the
end on board. The balza began to move; slowly at first, for the
current under the bushes was very slight.</p>

<p>All at once the attention of the voyagers was called to the strange
conduct of the pet monkey. That little creature was running to and
fro, first upon the roof of the toldo, then down again, all the while
uttering the most piercing shrieks as if something was biting off its
tail! It was observed to look forward and upward toward the
branch of the zamang, as if the object it dreaded was in that quarter.
The eyes of all were suddenly bent in the same direction. What was
their horror on beholding, stretched along the branch, the hideous
body of an enormous serpent! Only part of it could be seen; the
hinder half and the tail were hidden among the bromelias and vines
that in huge masses clustered around the trunk of the zamang, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
the head was among the leaflets of the mimosa; but what they saw
was enough to convince them that it was a snake of the largest size&mdash;the
great &ldquo;<i>water boa</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the <i>anaconda</i>!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/illus-287.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="ADVENTURE WITH AN ANACONDA." title="ADVENTURE WITH AN ANACONDA." />
<span class="caption">ADVENTURE WITH AN ANACONDA.</span></div>

<p>That part of the body in sight was full as thick as a man's thigh,
and covered with black spots or blotches upon a ground of dingy
yellow. It was seen to glisten as the animal moved, for the latter
was in motion, crawling along the branch <i>outward</i>! The next moment
its head appeared under the pendulous leaves; and its long forking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
tongue, protruding several inches from its mouth, seemed to feel the
air in front of it. This tongue kept playing backwards and forwards,
and its viscid covering glittered under the sunbeam, adding to the
hideous appearance of the monster.</p>

<p>To escape from passing within its reach would be impossible. The
balza was gliding directly under it! It could launch itself aboard at
will. It could seize upon any one of the party without coming from
the branch. It could coil its body around them, and crush them with
the constricting power of its muscles. It could do all this; for it had
crushed before now the tapir, the roebuck, perhaps even the jaguar
himself.</p>

<p>All on board the boat knew its dangerous power too well; and, of
course, terror was visible in every countenance.</p>

<p>Don Pablo seized the axe, and Guapo laid hold of his <i>machet&eacute;</i>. Do&ntilde;a
Isidora, Leon, and the little Leona, were standing&mdash;fortunately they
were&mdash;by the door of the toldo; and, in obedience to the cries and
hurried gestures of Don Pablo and the Indian, they rushed in and
flung themselves down. They had scarcely disappeared inside, when
the forward part of the balza upon which stood Don Pablo and Guapo,
came close to the branch, and the head of the serpent was on a level
with their own. Both aimed their blows almost at the same instant;
but their footing was unsteady, the boa drew back at the moment,
and both missed their aim. The next moment the current had carried
them out of reach, and they had no opportunity of striking a second
blow.</p>

<p>The moment they had passed the hideous head again dropped down,
and hung directly over, as if waiting. It was a moment of intense
anxiety to Don Pablo. His wife and children! Would it select one
as its victim, and leave the others? or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He had but little time for reflection. Already the head of the snake
was within three feet of the toldo door. Its eyes were glaring&mdash;it was
about to dart down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, God, have mercy!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Pablo, falling upon his
knees. &ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment a loud scream was heard. It came from the toldo;
and, at the same instant, the sa&iuml;miri was seen leaping out from the
door. Along with the rest, it had taken shelter within; but just as
the head of the snake came in sight, a fresh panic seemed to seize
upon it; and, as if under the influence of fascination, it leaped
screaming in the direction of the terrible object. It was met half
way. The wide jaws closed upon it, its shrieks were stifled, and the
next moment its silken body, along with the head of the anaconda,
disappeared among the leaves of the mimosa. Another moment passed,
and the balza swept clear of the branch, and floated triumphantly
into the open water.</p>

<p>Don Pablo sprang to his feet, ran into the toldo, and, after embracing
his wife and children, knelt down and offered thanks to God for
their almost miraculous deliverance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<div class="cap">A BATCH OF CURIOUS TREES.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>f course the escape from danger so imminent, after the first moments
were over, produced a sort of reaction in the feelings of all and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
were now rather joyous than otherwise. But with all there was a
mixture of regret when they thought of the fate of little &ldquo;titi.&rdquo; It
had been their only pet, and had grown to be such a favourite that its
loss was now mourned by every one, and its absence caused them to
feel as though one of the company had been left behind. Several times
during that day poor &ldquo;titi&rdquo; was the subject of conversation; indeed,
they could hardly talk about anything else. Little Leona was quite
inconsolable; for the pretty creature had loved Leona, and used to
perch on her shoulder by the hour, and draw her silken ringlets
through its tiny hand, and place its dainty little nose against the rich
velvet of her cheek, and play off all sorts of antics with her ears. Many
an hour did &ldquo;titi&rdquo; and Leona spend together. No wonder that the
creature was missed.</p>

<p>During the whole of that day they travelled through a country
covered with dense forest. The river was a full half-mile wide, but
sometimes there were islands, and then the current became narrowed
on each side, so that in passing, the balza almost touched the trees on
one side or the other. They saw many kinds of trees growing together,
and rarely a large tract covered with any one species of timber, for
this, as already remarked, is a peculiarity of the Amazon forest.</p>

<p>Many new and curious trees were noticed, of which Don Pablo gave
short botanical descriptions to the others, partly to instruct them, and
partly to while away the hours. Guapo, at the rudder, listened to
these learned lectures, and sometimes added some information of his
own about the properties of the trees, and the uses to which they were
put by the Indians. This is what is termed the popular part of the
science of botany, and, perhaps, it is more important than the mere
classification of genera and species, which is usually all the information
that you get from the learned and systematic botanists.</p>

<p>Among the trees passed to-day was one called the &ldquo;volador.&rdquo; This
is a large forest tree, with lobed leaves, of a heart-shape. But it is
the seeds which are curious, and which give to the tree the odd name
of &ldquo;volador,&rdquo; or &ldquo;flier.&rdquo; These seeds have each a pair of membranaceous
and striated wings, which, when the seeds fall, are turned
to meet the air at an angle of 45&deg;; and thus a rotatory motion is produced,
and the falling seeds turn round and round like little fly-wheels.
It is altogether a curious sight when a large volador is shaken in calm
weather, to see the hundreds of seeds whirling and wheeling towards
the ground, which they take a considerable time in reaching. The
volador is not confined to South America, I have seen it in Mexico,
and other parts of North America.</p>

<p>Another singular tree noticed was a tree of the barberry family
known among the Spanish-Americans as <i>barba de tigre</i>, or &ldquo;tiger's
beard.&rdquo; This name it derives from the fact of its trunk&mdash;which is very
large and high&mdash;being thickly set all over with sharp, branching thorns,
that are fancied to resemble the whiskers of the jaguar, or South
American &ldquo;tiger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A third remarkable tree (or bush) observed was the <i>Bixa orellana</i>,
which yields the well-known <i>arnatto</i> dye. This bush is ten or twelve
feet in height, and its seeds grow in a burr-like pericarp. These seeds
are covered with a reddish pulp, which produces the dye. The mode
of making it is simple. The Indian women throw the seeds into a
vessel of hot water, and stir them violently for about an hour, until
they have taken off the pulp. The water is then poured off, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
deposit, separated from the seeds, is mixed with oil of turtle-eggs, or
crocodile fat, and kneaded into cakes of three or four ounces weight.</p>

<p>It is then &ldquo;anoto,&rdquo; sometimes written &ldquo;arnatto,&rdquo; sometimes &ldquo;arnotto,&rdquo;
sometimes &ldquo;onoto,&rdquo; and sometimes &ldquo;anato.&rdquo; The first is the proper
spelling. In Brazil it is called &ldquo;urucu,&rdquo; whence the French name
&ldquo;rocou;&rdquo; and the Peruvians have still another designation for it,
&ldquo;achot&eacute;.&rdquo; Of course each tribe of Indians calls it by a separate name.
The botanic name, <i>Bixa</i>, is the ancient name by which it was known
to the Indians of Hayti, for it is found in most parts of tropical
America growing wild, although it is also cultivated. It is an article
in great demand among all the Indians of South America, who use it
for painting their bodies, and dyeing the cotton cloth of which they
make their garments.</p>

<p>But these people are very skilful in drawing pigments from plants
and trees of many kinds; in fact, their practical chemistry, so far as
it relates to dyes and poisons, is quite surprising, and from time to
time Guapo pointed out trees that were used by them, for such purposes.</p>

<p>One was a climbing plant, whose tendrils reached to the tops of the
highest trees. It had beautiful violet-coloured flowers, an inch long,
and Don Pablo saw that it was a species of <i>bignonia</i>. Guapo called it
&ldquo;chica.&rdquo; When in fruit it carries a pod two feet in length, full of
winged seeds. But Guapo said it was not from the seeds that the dye
was obtained, but from the leaves, which turn red when macerated in
water. The colouring matter comes out of the leaves in the form of a
light powder, and is then shaped into cakes, which sell among the
Indians for the value of a dollar each. This colour has a tinge of lake
in it, and is prized even more highly than the anoto. Indeed, red dyes
among all savage nations seem to hold a higher value than those of
any other colour.</p>

<p>Another dye-tree was the &ldquo;huitoc.&rdquo; This one is a slender tree, about
twenty feet high, with broad leaves shooting out from the stem, and
nuts growing at their bases, after the manner of the bread-fruit.
These nuts resemble black walnuts, and are of a russet colour outside;
but the pulp inside, which produces the huitoc, is of a dark blue, or
purple tint.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;wild indigo tree,&rdquo; was also seen growing in the woods, with a
leaf narrow at the base, and broad at the extremity. With these and
many other dyes the Indians of the Monta&ntilde;a paint their bodies in
fantastic modes. So much are they addicted to these customs, that,
among the Indians who labour at the missions, some have been known
to work nearly a month to procure paint enough to give their body a
single coat, and the missionaries have made a merchandise of this
gigantic folly. But the paint is not always to be looked upon in the
light of a mere folly, or vanity. Sometimes it is used to keep off the
&ldquo;zancudos,&rdquo; or mosquitoes, so numerous and annoying in these regions.</p>

<p>Another singular tree was observed, which Guapo called the
&ldquo;marima,&rdquo; or &ldquo;shirt-tree.&rdquo; The use of this he explained. The tree
stands fifty or sixty feet high, with a diameter of from two to three.
When they find them of this size, the Indians cut them down, and
then separate the trunk into pieces of about three feet long. From
these pieces they strip the bark, but without making any longitudinal
incision, so that the piece of bark when taken off is a hollow cylinder.
It is thin and fibrous, of a red colour, and looks like a piece of coarsely-woven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
sack-cloth. With this the shirt is made, simply by cutting
two holes in the sides to admit the arms, and the body being passed
into it, it is worn in time of rain. Hence the saying of the old
missionaries, that in the &ldquo;forests of America garments were found
ready-made on the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many other trees were noticed valuable for their fruits, or leaves,
or bark, or roots, or their wood. There was the well-known &ldquo;seringa,&rdquo;
or India-rubber tree; the great courbaril, the &ldquo;dragon's-blood&rdquo; tree,
not that celebrated tree of the East but one of a different genus from
whose white bark flows a red blood-like juice.</p>

<p>They saw, also, a species of cinnamon-tree though not the cinnamon
of commerce; the large tree that bears the Brazilian nut-meg (the
Puxiri); and that one, also, a large forest tree, that bears the nuts
known as &ldquo;Tonka beans,&rdquo; and which are used in the flavouring of
snuff.</p>

<p>But of all the trees which our travellers saw on that day, none made
such a impression upon them as the &ldquo;juvia,&rdquo; or Brazil-nut tree. This
tree is not one with a thick trunk; in fact, the largest ones are not
three feet in diameter, but it rises to a height of 120 feet. Its trunk
is branchless for more than half that height, and the branches then
spread out and droop, like the fronds of the palm. They are naked
near their bases, but loaded towards the top with tufts of silvery green
leaves, each two feet in length. The tree does not blossom until its
fifteenth year, and then it bears violet-coloured flowers; although
there is another species, the &ldquo;sapucaya,&rdquo; which has yellow ones. But
it is neither the trunk, nor the branches, nor the leaves, nor yet the
flowers of this tree, that render it such an object of curiosity. It is
the great woody and spherical pericarps that contain the nuts or fruits
that are wonderful. These are often as large as the head of a child,
and as hard as the shell of the cocoa-nut! Inside is found a large
number&mdash;twenty or more&mdash;of those triangular-shaped nuts which you
may buy at any Italian warehouse under the name of &ldquo;Brazil-nuts.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE FOREST FESTIVAL.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span>n consequence of their having rested but poorly on the preceding
night, it was determined that they should land at an early hour; and
this they did, choosing an open place on the shore. It was a very
pretty spot, and they could see that the woods in the background
were comparatively open, as though there were some meadows or
prairies between.</p>

<p>These openings, however, had been caused by fire. There had been
a growth of cane. It had been burned off and as yet was not grown
up again, though the young reeds were making their appearance like
a field of green wheat. Some places, and especially near the river,
the ground was still bare. This change in the landscape was quite
agreeable to our travellers; so much so, that they resolved to exercise
their limbs by taking a short stroll; and, having finished their late
dinner they set out. They all went together, leaving the balza and
camp to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>After walking a few hundred yards their ears were assailed by a
confused noise, as if all the animals in the forest had met and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
holding a <i>conversazione</i>. Some low bushes prevented them from seeing
what it meant, but on pushing their way through, they saw whence
and from what sort of creatures the noise proceeded.</p>

<p>Standing out in the open ground was a large and tall juvia-tree.
Its spreading branches were loaded with great globes as big as human
heads&mdash;each one, of course, full of delicious nuts. These were now
ripe, and some of them had already fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>Upon the ground an odd scene presented itself to the eyes of our
travellers. Between birds and animals assembled there, there were
not less than a dozen kinds, all as busy as they could be.</p>

<p>First, then, there were animals of the rodent kind. These were
pacas, agoutis and capivaras. The pacas were creatures a little larger
than hares, and not unlike them, except that their ears were shorter.
They were whitish on the under parts, but above were of a dark
brown colour, with rows of white spots along each side. They had
whiskers like the cat, consisting of long white bristles; and their
tails, like those of hares, were scarcely visible. The agoutis bore a
considerable resemblance to the pacas. Like these, they are also
rodent animals, but less in size; and instead of being spotted, they
are of a nearly uniform dark colour mixed with reddish brown.</p>

<p>Both pacas and agoutis are found in most parts of tropical America.
There are several species of each, and with the chinchillas and
viscachas already described, they occupy the place in those regions
that the hares and rabbits do in northern climates. Indeed, European
settlers usually know them by the names of hare or rabbit, and hunt
them in the same way. The flesh of most species is very good eating,
and they are therefore much sought after both by the natives and
colonists.</p>

<p>Along with these, near the juvia-tree, were several capivaras, already
noticed. But still more singular creatures on the ground were the
monkeys. Of these there were different kinds; but that which first
drew the attention of our party was the great Capuchin monkey.
This creature is not less than three feet in height and of a reddish
maroon colour. Its body is entirely different from the &ldquo;ateles&rdquo;
monkeys, being stouter and covered with a fuller coat of hair; and
its tail is large and bushy, without any prehensile power. It is, in
fact, less of a tree monkey than the <i>ateles</i>, although it also lives among
the branches. The most striking peculiarities of the Capuchin are
its head and face. In these it bears a stronger resemblance to the
human being than any other monkey in America.</p>

<p>The top of its head is covered with a crop of coarse hair, that lies
somewhat after the fashion of human hair; but, what most contributes
to the human expression is a large full beard and whiskers
reaching down to the breast, and arranged exactly after the fashion
of the huge beards worn by Orientals and some Frenchmen. There
were only two of these Capuchins on the ground&mdash;a male and female,
for this species does not associate in bands. The female one was
easily distinguished by her smaller size, and her beard was considerably
less than that of the male. The beards seemed to be objects of
special attention with both&mdash;especially the male, as every now and
then he was observed to stroke it down with his hand, just as a dandy
may be seen doing with his moustache or his well-brushed whiskers.</p>

<p>Another peculiar habit of the Capuchins was noticed. There was a
little pool of water close by. Every now and then they ran to this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
pool and took a drink from it. But in drinking they did not apply
their lips to the pool or lap like a dog. No; they lifted the water in
the hollow of their hands&mdash;hence their specific name of <i>chiropotes</i>, or
&ldquo;hand-drinking monkeys.&rdquo; They raised the water to their lips with
great care, taking pains not to let a drop of it fall on their precious
beards. From this habit of going so often to quench their thirst, the
Capuchin monkeys have in some parts got the name of &ldquo;hard-drinking
monkeys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apart from these was a troop of monkeys of a very different species.
They were nearly of the same size, but more of the shape of the
&ldquo;ateles;&rdquo; and their long tails, naked underneath and curling downward
near the points, showed that, like them too, they possessed
prehensile power in that member. Such was the fact, for they were
&ldquo;howling monkeys;&rdquo; and some species of these can use the tail
almost as adroitly as the &ldquo;ateles&rdquo; themselves. Those that our
travellers saw were the &ldquo;guaribas,&rdquo; nearly black in colour, but with
their hands covered with yellow hair, whence their name among the
naturalists of &ldquo;yellow-handed howler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were seated in a ring when first observed, and one&mdash;apparently
the chief of the band&mdash;was haranguing the rest; but so rapid were
his articulations, and so changeable the tones of his voice, that any
one would have thought the whole party were chattering together.
This, in effect, did occur at intervals, and then you might have heard
them to the distance of more than a mile. These creatures are
enabled to produce this vast volume of voice in consequence of a
hollow bony structure at the root of the tongue, which acts as a drum,
and which gives them the appearance of a swelling, or goitre, in the
throat. This is common to all the howling monkeys as well as the
guaribas.</p>

<p>Besides the howlers there were other species&mdash;there were tamarins,
and ouistitis, and the black coaitas of the genus &ldquo;ateles,&rdquo; all assembled
around the juvia-tree. There were parrots, and macaws, and other
nut-eating birds. High above in the air soared the great eagle
watching his opportunity to swoop down on the pacas or agoutis, his
natural prey. It was altogether a singular assemblage of wild
animals&mdash;a zoological garden of the wilderness.</p>

<p>Our party, concealed by bushes, looked on for some time. They
noticed that not one of all the living things was <i>under</i> the tree. On
the contrary, they formed&mdash;monkeys, cavies, parrots, and all&mdash;a sort
of ring around it, but at such a distance that none of the branches
were above them! Why was this? Guapo knew the reason well,
and before leaving their place of observation the others had an explanation
of it.</p>

<p>While they stood gazing, one of the great globes was seen to fall
from the tree above. The loud report as it struck the earth could
have been heard a long way off. It caused the whole assemblage of
living creatures to start. The macaws flapped their wings, the
monkeys ran outward and then stopped, and a simultaneous cry
from the voices of both birds and beasts echoed on all sides; and
then there was a general chattering and screaming, as though the
fall of the great pericarp had given pleasure to all parties.</p>

<p>It was very evident from this circumstance why both beasts and
birds kept so far out from the tree. One of these fruits coming down
like a nine-pound shot would have crushed any of them to atoms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Indeed, so heavy are they, that one of them falling from a height of
fifty or sixty feet will dash out the brains of a man; and the Indians
who gather them go under the trees with great wooden helmets that
cover both the head and shoulders! It would be no boy's play to
&ldquo;go a nutting&rdquo; in a wood of juvia-trees.</p>

<p>But how did the monkeys and birds get at the nuts? Neither of
these could break open the outer shell. This is full half an inch
thick, and so hard that it can scarcely be cut with a saw. How could
either monkeys or birds open it?&mdash;that was the question put to
Guapo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch them,&rdquo; said Guapo.</p>

<p>All kept their eyes bent attentively on what was going on; and
to their astonishment they observed that neither the monkeys nor
the birds had anything to do with the opening of the shells. That
was entirely the work of the rodent animals, the pacas, cavies, and
agoutis. These with their fine cutting teeth laid open the thick
pericarps, and whenever one was seen to have succeeded, and the
triangular nuts were scattered upon the ground, then there was a
general rush, and macaws, parrots, and monkeys scrambled for a
share.</p>

<p>The monkeys, however, did their part of the work. Whenever a
fruit fell from the tree, one or two of them, deputed by the others,
were seen to run in and roll it out, all the while exhibiting symptoms
of great terror. They would then lift it in their hands, several of
them together, and dash it repeatedly upon a stone. Sometimes,
when the shell was not a strong one, they succeeded in breaking it
in this way; but oftener they were not able, and then it was left to
the rodent animals, who were watched at their operations, and
usually robbed of the fruits of their labour. Such were the singular
incidents witnessed at this festival of juvia-nuts.</p>

<p>But the scene was brought to a sudden termination. A cry was
heard that rose far above all the other noises&mdash;a cry more terrible
than the screams of the parrots, or the shrieks of the howling
monkeys&mdash;it was the cry of the jaguar! It came from a piece of
wood close to the juvia-trees, and the branches were heard to crackle
as the dreaded utterer advanced.</p>

<p>In a moment the ground was cleared of every creature. Even the
winged birds had flew up from the spot, and perched upon the
branches; the cavies took to the water; the pacas and agouties to
their burrows; and the monkeys to the tops of the adjacent trees;
and nothing remained on the ground but the empty shells of the
juvias.</p>

<p>Our party did not stay to notice the change. They, too, had been
warned by the roar of the tiger, and hastily leaving the spot, returned
to their place of encampment. On reaching it, they kindled a large
circle of fire to keep them in safety during the night. They saw no
more of the jaguar, although at intervals through the midnight
hours, they were awakened by his loud and savage cry, resounding
through the openings of the forest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">ACRES OF EGGS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he next evening our travellers encamped on a sand-bar, or rather
a great bank of sand, that ran for miles along one side of the river.
Of course they had nothing to hang their hammocks to, but that
was a matter of no importance, for the sand was dry and soft, and
of itself would make a comfortable bed, as pleasant to sleep on as a
hair-mattress. They only wanted wood enough to cook with, and
to keep up their fire during the night&mdash;so as to frighten off the wild
beasts.</p>

<p>This night they kept watch as usual, Leon taking the first turn.
In fact, they found that they must do so every night&mdash;as in each of
the camps where they had slept some danger had threatened; and
they thought it would be imprudent for all to go to sleep at the
same time. The heaviest part of the sentinel's duty fell to Guapo's
share; but Guapo had long accustomed himself to go without sleep,
and did not mind it; moreover Don Pablo took longer spells at the
stern-oar during the day, and allowed Guapo many a &ldquo;cat-nap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leon seated himself upon a pile of sand that he had gathered up,
and did his best to keep awake, but in about an hour after the rest
were asleep he felt very drowsy&mdash;in fact, quite as much so as on the
night of the adventure with the vampire. He used pretty much the
same means to keep himself awake, but not with so good success, for
on this occasion he fell into a nap that lasted nearly half-an-hour,
and might have continued still longer, had he not slid down the
sand-hill and tumbled over on his side. This awoke him; and feeling
vexed with himself, he rubbed his eyes as if he was going to push
them deeper into their sockets.</p>

<p>When this operation was finished, he looked about to see if any
creature had ventured near. He first looked towards the woods&mdash;for
of course that was the direction from which the tigers would
come, and these were the only creatures he feared; but he had
scarcely turned himself when he perceived a pair of eyes glancing at
him from the other side of the fire. Close to them another pair,
then another and another, until having looked on every side, he saw
himself surrounded by a complete circle of glancing eyes! It is true
they were small ones, and some of the heads which he could see by
the blaze, were small&mdash;they were not jaguars, but they had an ugly
look&mdash;they looked like the heads of serpents! Was it possible that
an hundred serpents could have surrounded the camp?</p>

<p>Brought suddenly to his feet, Leon stood for some moments uncertain
how to act. He fully believed they were snakes&mdash;anacondas,
or water-snakes no doubt&mdash;that had just crept out of the river; and
he felt that a movement on his part would bring on their united and
simultaneous attack upon the sleeping party. Partly influenced by
this fear, and again exhibiting that coolness and prudence which we
have already noticed as a trait of his character, he remained for some
moments silent and motionless.</p>

<p>Having already risen to his feet, his eyes were now above the level
of the blaze, and, as they got the sleep well scared out of them, he
could see things more distinctly. He now saw that the snake-like
heads were attached to large oval-shaped bodies, and that, besides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
the half hundred or so that had gathered around the fires, there
were whole droves of the same upon the sandy beach beyond. The
white surface was literally covered as far as he could see on all sides
of him with black moving masses; and where the rays of the moon
fell upon the beach, there was a broad belt that glistened and
sparkled as though she shone upon pieces of glass kept constantly in
motion!</p>

<p>A singular sight it was; and to Leon, who had never heard of
such before, a most fearful one. For the life of him he could not
make out what it all meant, or by what sort of odd creatures they
were surrounded. He had but an indistinct view of them, but he
could see that their bodies were not larger than those of a small
sheep, and from the way in which they glistened under the moon he
was sure they were water-animals, and had come out of the river!</p>

<p>He did not stay to speculate any longer upon them. He resolved
to wake Guapo; but in doing so the whole party were aroused, and
started to their feet in some alarm and confusion. The noise and
movement had its effect on the nocturnal visitors; for before Leon
could explain himself, those immediately around the fires and for
some distance beyond rushed to the edge, and were heard plunging
by hundreds into the water.</p>

<p>Guapo's ear caught the sounds, and his eye now ranging along the
sandy shore, took in at a glance the whole thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carapas,&rdquo; he said laconically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carapas?&rdquo; inquired Leon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Don Pablo, who understood him. &ldquo;Turtles is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, master,&rdquo; replied Guapo. &ldquo;This is, I suppose, one of their
great hatching-places. They are going to lay their eggs somewhere
in the sand above. They do so every year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no danger from the turtles, as Guapo assured everybody,
but the fright had chased away sleep, and they all lay awake for
some time listening to Guapo's account of these singular creatures,
which we shall translate into our own phraseology.</p>

<p>These large turtles, which in other parts of South America are
called &ldquo;arraus,&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;tortugas,&rdquo; assemble every year in large
armies, from all parts of the river. Each one of these armies chooses
for itself a place to breed&mdash;some sandy island, or great sand-bank.
This they approach very cautiously&mdash;lying near it for some days, and
reconnoitring it with only their heads above the water. They then
crawl ashore at night in vast multitudes&mdash;just as the party saw them&mdash;and
each turtle, with the strong crooked claws of her hind feet,
digs a hole for herself in the sand. These holes are three feet in
diameter and two deep. In this she deposits her eggs&mdash;from seventy
to one hundred and twenty of them&mdash;each egg being white, hard-shelled,
and between the size of a pigeon's and pullet's. She then
covers the whole with sand, levelling it over the top so that it may
look like the rest of the surface, and so that the precious treasure
may not be found by vultures, jaguars, and other predatory creatures.
When this is done the labour of the turtle is at an end.</p>

<p>The great army again betakes itself to the water, and scatters in
every direction. The sun acting upon the hot sand does the rest;
and in less than six weeks the young turtles, about an inch in
diameter, crawl out of the sand, and at once make for the water.
They are afterwards seen in pools and lakes, where the water is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
shallow, far from the place where they have been hatched; and
it is well known that the first years of their life are not spent in the
bed of the great river. How they find these pools, or whether
the mothers distinguish their own young and conduct them thither,
as the crocodiles and alligators do, is a mystery. With these last
the thing is more easy, as the crocodile mothers deposit their eggs in
separate places, and each returns for her young when they are
hatched, calls them by her voice, and guides them to the pool where
they are to remain until partly grown.</p>

<p>But among the thousands of little turtles hatched at one place and
time, and that seek the water altogether, how would it be possible
for the turtle mother to distinguish her own young? Yet an old
female turtle is frequently seen swimming about with as many as
a hundred little ones after her! Now are these her own, or are they
a collection picked up out of the general progeny? That is an
undetermined question. It would seem impossible that each turtle
mother should know her own young, yet amidst this apparent
confusion there may be some maternal instinct that guides her to
distinguish her own offspring from all the rest. Who can say?</p>

<p>It is not often, however, that the turtle is permitted to have offspring
at all. These creatures are annually robbed of their eggs
in millions. They have many enemies, but man is the chief. When
a turtle hatching place is discovered, the Indians assemble, and as
soon as all the eggs have been deposited, they uncover and collect
them. They eat them&mdash;but that is not the principal use to which
they are put. It is for the making of oil, or &ldquo;tortoise-butter,&rdquo; they
are collected.</p>

<p>The eggs are thrown into a large trough or canoe, where they are
broken up with a wooden spade and stirred about for awhile. They
then remain exposed to the sun, until the oily part collects on the
surface, which is then skimmed off and well boiled. The &ldquo;tortoise-butter&rdquo;
is now made, and after being poured into earthen jars or
bottles, it is ready for market. The oil is clear, of a pale yellow
colour, and some regard it as equal to the best olive oil, both for
lamps and for cooking. Sometimes, however, it has a putrid smell,
because many of the eggs are already half hatched before the
gathering takes place.</p>

<p>What would be the result were these eggs not gathered by the
Indians? Perhaps in the different rivers of South America more
than an hundred millions of them are deposited every year! In the
Orinoco alone, in three principal hatching places, it has been
calculated that at least thirty three millions are annually destroyed
for the making of tortoise-butter! Fancy, then, one hundred
millions of animals, each of which grows to the weight of fifty or
sixty pounds, being produced every year, and then the increase
in production which these would make if left to themselves! Why
the rivers would be crowded; and it would be true what old Father
Gumilla once asserted, that &ldquo;It would be as difficult to count the
grains of sand on the shores of the Orinoco, as to count the immense
number of tortoises that inhabit its margins and waters. Were it
not for the vast consumption of tortoises and their eggs, the river,
despite its great magnitude, would be unnavigable, for vessels would
be impeded by the enormous multitude of the tortoises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But nature has provided against this &ldquo;over-population&rdquo; of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
turtles by giving them a great many enemies. The jaguars, the
ocelots, the crocodiles, the cranes, and the vultures, all prey upon
them; and, perhaps, if man were to leave them alone, the result
would be, not such a great increase in the number of the turtles, but
that the creatures who prey upon them would come in for a larger
share.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;carapa,&rdquo; or arrau turtle, is, when full grown, forty or fifty
pounds in weight. It is of a dark green colour above and orange
beneath, with yellow feet. There are many other species of fresh-water
turtles in the rivers of South America, but these breed separately,
each female choosing her own place, and making her deposit
alone. Indeed, some of the smaller species, as the &ldquo;terekay,&rdquo; are
more esteemed both for their flesh and eggs; but as a large quantity
of these eggs is never found together, they are not collected as
an article of trade, but only to be roasted and eaten. The white
does not coagulate in roasting or boiling, and only the yolk is eaten,
but that is esteemed quite as palatable as the eggs of the common
fowl.</p>

<p>The flesh of all kinds is eaten by the Indians, who fry it in pots,
and then pour it with its own oil into other vessels and permit it
to cool. When thus prepared, it will keep for a long time, and
can be taken out when required for use.</p>

<p>Most of the above particulars were communicated by Guapo; and
when he had finished talking, all the others went to sleep, leaving
Guapo to his midnight vigil.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>

<div class="cap">A FIGHT BETWEEN TWO VERY SCALY CREATURES.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">W</span>hen they awoke in the morning they found Guapo busy over the
fire. He had already been at the turtles' nests, and had collected a
large basketful of the eggs, some of which he was cooking for breakfast.
In addition to the eggs, moreover, half-a-dozen large turtles
lay upon their backs close by. The flesh of these Guapo intended to
scoop out and fry down, so as to be carried away as a sort of stock of
preserved meat;&mdash;and a very excellent idea it was. He had caught
them during his watch as they came out of the water.</p>

<p>All the turtles had gone off, although this is not always the case;
for frequently numbers that have not finished covering their eggs
during the night may be seen hard at work in the morning, and so
intent on it, that they do not heed the presence of their worst
enemies. These the Indians denominate &ldquo;mad tortoises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This morning, however, no &ldquo;mad tortoises&rdquo; were to be seen; but
when our travellers cast their eyes along the beach they saw quite a
number that appeared to be turned upon their backs just like those
that Guapo had capsized. They were at some distance from the
camp, but curiosity prompted our travellers to walk along the beach
and examine them. Sure enough there were nearly a dozen large
tortoises regularly laid on their backs, and unable to stir; but, besides
these, there were several tortoise-shells out of which the flesh had
been freshly scooped, and these were as neatly cleaned out as if the
work had been done by an anatomist. All this would have been a
mystery but for the experience of Guapo; but Guapo knew it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
the jaguar that had turned the tortoises on their backs, and that had
cleaned out and eaten the flesh from the empty shells!</p>

<p>Now, it is no easy thing for a man, provided with the necessary
implements, to separate the flesh of a tortoise from its shell, and yet
the jaguar, with his paw, can in a few minutes perform this operation
most adroitly, as our travellers had full proof. All that they
saw had been done that same night; and it gave them no very
pleasant feeling to know that the jaguar had been at work so near
them.</p>

<p>This animal, as Guapo said, in attacking the turtles, first turns
them over, so as to prevent their escape&mdash;for the &ldquo;carapas&rdquo; are of
those tortoises that once upon their backs on level ground cannot
right themselves again. He then proceeds to tear out the flesh, and
eats it at his leisure. Oftentimes he capsizes a far greater number
than he can eat, and even returns to the spot to have a second meal
of them; but frequently the Indians wandering along the river, find
the tortoises he has turned over, and of course make an easy capture
of them.</p>

<p>Guapo, upon this occasion, took advantage of the jaguar's skill,
and carried to the camp all that the latter had left. It was Guapo's
design to make a large quantity of &ldquo;turtle sausage-meat,&rdquo; so that
they might have a supply for many days, as by this time even Guapo
himself was getting tired of the horse-flesh &ldquo;charqui.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were about returning to camp, when their attention was
drawn to two dark objects upon the sand-beach a little farther on.
These objects were in motion, and at first they believed they were a
pair of &ldquo;mad tortoises&rdquo; that had not yet returned to the water,
although they were close to its edge.</p>

<p>Led on by curiosity our party approached them, and saw that one
only was a tortoise, and one of the largest kind, being nearly three
feet in diameter. The other animal was a small ca&iuml;man or alligator.</p>

<p>As our travellers drew near they saw that these two creatures were
engaged in a fierce and deadly combat. Now, it is a curious fact
that the larger alligators and crocodiles are among the most destructive
enemies which the turtles have, eating thousands of the
latter while they are still tiny little creatures and unable to defend
themselves; and, on the other hand, that the turtles prey extensively
on the young of both alligators and crocodiles, eating them whenever
they can catch them! I say this is a curious fact in natural history,
and it seems a sort of retaliatory principle established between these
two kinds of reptiles, as if they ate one another's offspring <i>en
revanche</i>.</p>

<p>There is no feeling of revenge, however, in the matter. It is
merely an instinct of appetite by which both kinds will eat almost
any small fry they come across. In fact, the alligators and crocodiles
not only eat the young of the turtles, but their own young as
well. That is, the <i>old males</i> do; and it has been stated, that the
males of some species of tortoises have a similar unnatural appetite.</p>

<p>The turtle of which we are speaking is one of the most carnivorous
of the whole race, and one of the fiercest in its nature too; so much
so, that it has earned the name of the &ldquo;fierce tortoise.&rdquo; It will eat
fish and small crustacea, and almost any living thing it finds in the
water, which is not too large for it. It is extremely expert in
catching its prey. It lies concealed at the bottom among the roots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
of flags and nymph&aelig;; and when any small fish chances to pass it, by
means of its long neck darts out its head and seizes upon its unsuspecting
victim. Once the bill of the &ldquo;fierce turtle&rdquo; has closed upon
any object its hold is secure. You may cut its head off, but otherwise
it cannot be forced to let go, until it has either captured its prey
or taken the piece with it. It will &ldquo;nip&rdquo; a stout walking-cane
between its mandibles, as if it was no more than a rush.</p>

<p>A very good story is told of a thief and a tortoise. The thief was
prowling about the larder of an hotel in search of plunder, when he
came upon a large market-basket filled with provisions. He immediately
inserted his hand to secure the contents, when he felt himself
suddenly seized by the fingers, and bitten so severely, that he
was fain to draw back his hand in the most hasty manner possible.
But along with the hand he drew out a &ldquo;snapping&rdquo; turtle. To get
rid of the &ldquo;ugly customer&rdquo; was his next care; but, in spite of all
his efforts, the turtle held on, determined to have the finger. The
scuffle, and the shouts which pain compelled the thief to give utterance
to, awoke the landlord and the rest of the household; and
before the thief could disengage himself and escape, he was secured
and given into custody.</p>

<p>Well, it was just a tortoise of this species, a &ldquo;snapping turtle,&rdquo; and
one of the largest size, that our travellers now saw doing battle with
the ca&iuml;man. The ca&iuml;man was not one of large size, else the turtle
would have fled from it, not that even the largest ca&iuml;mans are feared
by the full-grown <i>carapas</i>. No; the strong plate-armour of the
latter protects them both from the teeth and tail of this antagonist.
The jaguar, with his pliable paws and sharp subtle claws, is to them
a more dreaded assailant than the crocodile or ca&iuml;man.</p>

<p>The one in question was some six or seven feet long, and altogether
not much heavier than the turtle itself. It was not for the purpose
of eating each other they fought. No&mdash;their strife was evidently on
other grounds. No doubt the ca&iuml;man had been attempting to plunder
the new-laid eggs of the tortoise, and the latter had detected him in
the act. At all events, the struggle must have been going on for
some time, for the sand was torn up, and scored, in many places, by
the sharp claws of both.</p>

<p>The battle appeared to be still at its height when our party
arrived on the spot. Neither tortoise nor ca&iuml;man paid any attention
to their presence, but fought on pertinaciously. The aim of the
ca&iuml;man appeared to be to get the head of the tortoise in his mouth;
but whenever he attempted this, the latter suddenly drew his head
within the shell, and repeatedly disappointed him. The tortoise, on
its part, rose at intervals upon its hind-feet, and making a dash forward,
would dart forth its long neck, and clutch at the softer parts
of its antagonist's body just under the throat. Several times it had
succeeded in this man&#339;uvre, and each time it had brought the piece
with it, so that the ca&iuml;man was already somewhat mangled. Another
man&#339;uvre of the tortoise was to seize the tail of its antagonist.
Instinct seemed to teach it that this was a vulnerable part, and for
the purpose of reaching the tail, it constantly kept crawling and
edging round towards it.</p>

<p>Now, there is no movement so difficult for a reptile of the crocodile
kind as to turn its body on dry land. The peculiar formation of the
vertebr&aelig;, both of its neck and spine, renders this movement difficult;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
and in &ldquo;changing front,&rdquo; the reptile is forced to describe a full circle
with its unwieldy body&mdash;in fact to turn &ldquo;all of a piece.&rdquo; The tortoise,
therefore, had the advantage, and, after several efforts, he at
length succeeded in outflanking his antagonist, and getting right
round to his rear. He lost no time, but, raising himself to his full
height and making a dart forward, seized the tail and held on. He
had caught by the very tip, and it was seen that his horny mandibles
had taken a proper hold.</p>

<p>Now commenced a somewhat ludicrous scene. The ca&iuml;man, though
but a small one, with the immense muscular power which he possessed
in his tail, if not able to detach his antagonist, was able to
give him a sound shaking, and the turtle was seen vibrating from
side to side, dragged along the sand. He held his broad yellow feet
spread out on all sides, so as to preserve his equilibrium, for he well
knew that to lose that would be to lose his life. Should he get
turned on his back it would be all over with him; but he carefully
guarded against such a fatal catastrope. Of course there were
intervals when the ca&iuml;man became tired, and remained still for a
moment; and at each of these intervals the tortoise renewed his
hold, and, in fact, as our party now perceived, was slowly, though
surely, <i>eating the tail</i>!</p>

<p>When this had continued a short while, the great saurian seemed
to despair. The pain, no doubt, caused him to weep &ldquo;crocodile's
tears,&rdquo; though none were seen, but his eyes glared with a lurid light,
and he began to look around for some means of escape from his painful
position. His eye fell upon the water. That promised something,
although he knew full well the turtle was as much at home there as
he. At all events, his situation could not be a worse one, and with
this, or some such reflection, he made a &ldquo;dash&rdquo; for the water. He
was but a few feet from it, but it cost him a good deal of pulling and
dragging, and clawing the sand, before he could get into it. In fact,
the tortoise knew that its position could not be benefited by the
change, and would have preferred fighting it out on dry land, and to
do this he set <i>his</i> claws as firmly as possible, and pulled the tail in
the opposite direction!</p>

<p>The strength of the ca&iuml;man at length prevailed. He got his body
into the water, and, with a few strokes of his webbed feet, jerked the
turtle after, and both were now fairly launched. Once in the river,
the ca&iuml;man seemed to gain fresh vigour. His tail vibrated violently
and rapidly, throwing the tortoise from side to side until the foam
floated around them, and then both suddenly sank to the bottom.</p>

<p>Whether they continued &ldquo;attached,&rdquo; or became &ldquo;separated&rdquo; there,
or whether the turtle killed the lizard, or the lizard the turtle, or
&ldquo;each did kill the other,&rdquo; no one ever knew, as it is highly probable
that no human eye ever saw either of them again.</p>

<p>At all events, no one of <i>our</i> party saw any more of them; and,
having watched the surface for some time, they turned in their steps
and walked back to the camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>

<div class="cap">A PAIR OF VALIANT VULTURES.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>hey had got into a part of the river that seemed to be a favourite
resort with turtles and crocodiles, and creatures of that description.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
At different times they saw turtles of different kinds; among others,
the &ldquo;painted turtle,&rdquo; a beautiful species that derives its name from
the fine colouring of its shell, which appears as if it had been painted
in enamel. Of crocodiles, too, they saw three or four distinct species,
and not unfrequently, the largest of all, the great black crocodile
(<i>Jacare nigra</i>). This was sometimes seen of the enormous length of
over twenty feet! Terrible-looking as these crocodiles are, they are
not masters of every creature upon the river. There are even birds
that can sorely vex them, and compel them to take to the water to
save themselves from a fearful calamity&mdash;blindness.</p>

<p>One day, while descending the river, our travellers were witness to
an illustration of this.</p>

<p>They were passing a wide sand-bank that shelved back from the
river, with a scarcely perceptible slope, when they saw, at a distance
of about two hundred yards from the water's edge, a crocodile
making for the river. He looked as though he had just awoke from
his torpid sleep, for his body was caked all over with dry mud, and
he seemed both hungry and thirsty. It was like enough he was
coming from some inland pond, where the water had dried up, and
he was now on his way to the river.</p>

<p>All at once two dark shadows were seen passing over the white
surface of the sand-bank. In the heaven two large birds were
wheeling about, crossing each other in their courses, and holding
their long necks downwards, as if the crocodile was the object of
their regard.</p>

<p>The latter, on seeing them, paused; and lowered his body into a
squatted or crouching attitude, as if in the birds he recognised an
enemy. And yet what could such a large creature fear from a pair
of &ldquo;king-vultures?&rdquo; for king vultures they were, as was easily seen
by their red-orange heads and cream-coloured plumage. What could
a crocodile, full ten feet long, fear from these, even had they been
eagles, or the great condor himself? No matter; he was evidently
frightened at them; and each time that they drew near in their
flight, he stopped and flattened his body against the sand, as if that
might conceal him. As soon as they flew off again to a more distant
point of their a&euml;rial circle, he would once more elevate himself on his
arms, and make all haste toward the water.</p>

<p>He had got within about an hundred yards of the river, when the
birds made a sudden turn in the sky, and swooping down, alighted
upon the sand directly before the snout of the crocodile. The latter
stopped again, and kept his eyes fixed upon them. They did not
leave him long to rest; for one of them, making a few hops towards
him, came so close, that it might have been supposed the crocodile
could have seized it in his jaws. This, in fact, he attempted to do;
but the wary bird threw up its broad wings, and flapped to one side
out of his reach.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other had hopped close up to his opposite shoulder;
and while the crocodile was engaged with the first one, this made a
dash forward, aiming its great open beak at the eye of the reptile.
The crocodile parried the thrust by a sudden turn of his head; but
he had scarcely got round, when the second vulture, watching its
opportunity, rushed forward at the other eye. It must have succeeded
in pecking it, for the great lizard roared out with the pain;
and rushing forward a bit, writhed and lashed the sand with his tail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>The vultures paid no attention to these demonstrations, but only
kept out of the way of the teeth and claws of their antagonist; and
then, when he became still again, both returned to the attack as
before. One after the other was seen dashing repeatedly forward&mdash;using
both legs and wings to effect their object, and each time
darting out their great beaks towards the eyes of the reptile. The
head of the latter kept continuously moving from side to side; but
move where it would, the beaks of the vultures were ready to meet
it, and to pierce into the sockets of those deep lurid eyes.</p>

<p>This terrible contest lasted all the time the balza was floating by.
It was a slow current at this place, and our travellers were a long
time in passing, so that they had a good opportunity of witnessing
the strange spectacle. Long after they had glided past, they saw
that the conflict continued. They could still perceive the black body
of the reptile upon the white sand-bank, writhing and struggling,
while the flapping wings of the vultures showed that they still kept
up their terrible attack. But the head of the crocodile was no longer
directed towards the water.</p>

<p>At the first onset the reptile had used every effort to retreat in
that direction. He knew that his only safety lay in getting into the
river, and sinking beyond the reach of his adversaries. At every
interval between their assaults, he had been seen to crawl forward,
stopping only when compelled to defend himself. Now, however,
his head was seen turned from the water; sometimes he lay parallel
with the stream; and sometimes he appeared to be heading back for
the woods, while his struggles and contortions betrayed the agony
he was undergoing. But his turning in this way was easily accounted
for. He knew not in what direction lay the river. He could no
longer see. His eyes were mutilated by the beaks of the birds.
<i>He was blind!</i></p>

<p>Guapo said the vultures would not leave him until they had made
a meal of his eyes, and that was all they wanted. He would then
remain on shore, perhaps without finding his way back to the water,
and most likely be attacked by jaguars, or other preying creatures,
who could conquer him the easier now that he was deprived of his
sight!</p>

<p>As the balza glided on, Guapo told our travellers many strange
stories of crocodiles. He stated, what is well known to be true, that
in the rivers of South America many people are every year killed by
these ravenous creatures; in fact, far more than have ever fallen
victims to the salt-sea sharks. In some places they are much fiercer
than in others; but this may arise from different species being the
inhabitants of these different places. There is the true crocodile,
with long sharp snout, and large external tusks; and the ca&iuml;man,
with a snout broader and more pike-shaped; and the former is a
much more courageous and man-eating creature. Both are often
found in the same river; but they do not associate together, but
keep in distinct bands or societies; and they are often mistaken for
each other.</p>

<p>This may account for the difference of opinion that exists in regard
to the fierceness of these reptiles&mdash;many asserting that they are utterly
harmless, and will not attack man under any circumstances; while
others, who have witnessed their attacks, of course bearing testimony
to the contrary. There are many places in South America, where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
natives will fearlessly enter a lake or river known to be full of crocodiles,
and drive these creatures aside with a piece of a stick; but there are
other districts where nothing will tempt an Indian to swim across a
river infested with these reptiles. In the Amazon districts, in every
Indian village, several people may be seen who have been maimed by
crocodiles. No wonder that among author-travellers there should be
such a difference of opinion.</p>

<p>Guapo stated, that when an Indian has been seized by a crocodile
in its great jaws, he has only one chance of escape, and that is, by
thrusting his fingers into the eyes of the reptile. This will invariably
cause it to let go its hold, and generally frighten it, so as to enable the
person to escape. It, of course, requires great presence of mind to
effect this, as the person who has been seized will himself be in great
pain from the tearing teeth of the monster, and, perhaps, will have
been drawn under the water, before he can gather his senses. But it
has often occurred that Indians, and even women, have escaped in this
way.</p>

<p>The eyes of the crocodile are its most tender parts,&mdash;in fact, the only
parts that can be made to feel pain. A crocodile may be disabled by
cutting at the root of its tail, but it can only be frightened by an
attack upon the eyes; and this appears to be a well-known fact, not
only to the Indians, but to all its other enemies among the birds and
quadrupeds.</p>

<p>The young crocodiles are often attacked, and have their eyes pecked
out, by the small gallinazo or &ldquo;zamuro&rdquo; vultures just in the same
way that we have seen one of a larger size become the victim of the
more powerful king vultures.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE &ldquo;GAPO.&rdquo;</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span>fter many days of rafting our travellers arrived in a most singular
country. They were now approaching the mighty Amazon, and the
river upon which they had hitherto been travelling appeared to divide
into many branches, where it formed <i>deltas</i> with the Amazon. Every
day, and sometimes two or three times in the day, they passed places
where the river forked, as though each branch passed round an island,
but our travellers perceived that these branches did not meet again;
and they conjectured that they all fell into the Amazon by separate
embouchures. They were often puzzled to know which one to take,
as the main river was not always broadest, and they might get into
one that was not navigable below. A curious region it was through
which they passed; for, in fact, they were now travelling in the
country of the &ldquo;Gapo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What is the &ldquo;Gapo?&rdquo; you will ask. The &ldquo;Gapo,&rdquo; then, is the name
given to vast tracts of country upon the Amazon and some of its
tributary streams, that are annually inundated, and remain under
water for several months in the year. It extends for hundreds of
miles along the Amazon itself, and up many of the rivers, its tributaries
also, for hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>But the whole country does not become one clear sheet of water, as
is the case with floods in other parts of the world. On the contrary,
high as is the flood, the tree-tops and their branches rise still higher,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
and we have in the &ldquo;Gapo&rdquo; the extraordinary spectacle of a flooded
forest, thousands of square miles in extent!</p>

<p>In this forest the trees do not perish, but retain life and verdure.
In fact, the trees of this part are peculiar, most of them differing in
kind from the trees of any other region. There are species of palms
growing in the &ldquo;Gapo&rdquo; that are found nowhere else; and there are
animals and birds, too, that remain in this region during the whole
season of flood. It has been further asserted that there are tribes of
&ldquo;Gapo&rdquo; Indians, who live in the middle of the inundation, making
their dwellings upon the trees, and who can pass from branch to branch
and tree to tree almost as nimbly as monkeys.</p>

<p>This may or may not be true. It would not be a new thing, if true,
for it is well known that the Guarano Indians, at the mouth of the
Orinoco, dwell among the tops of the murichi palms during many
months of the season of flood. These people build platforms on the
palms, and upon these erect roofs, and sling their hammocks, and,
with little fireplaces of mud, are enabled to cook their provisions upon
them. But they have canoes, in which they are able to go from place
to place, and capture fish, upon which they principally subsist. The
murichi palm furnishes them with all the other necessaries of life.</p>

<p>This singular tree is one of the noblest of the palms. It rises to a
height of more than one hundred feet, and grows in immense <i>palmares</i>,
or palm-woods, often covering the bank of the river for miles. It is
one of those called &ldquo;fan-palm&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the leaves, instead of being
pinnate or feathery, have long naked stalks, at the end of which the
leaflets spread out circularly, forming a shape like a fan. One of the
murichi leaves is a grand sight. The leaf-stalk, or petiole, is a foot
thick where it sprouts from the trunk; and before it reaches the
leaflets it is a solid beam of ten or twelve feet long, while the circular
fan or leaf itself is nine or ten in diameter! A single leaf of the
murichi palm is a full load for a man.</p>

<p>With a score of such leaves,&mdash;shining and ever verdant as they are,&mdash;at
the top of its column-like trunk, what a majestic tree is the
murichi palm!</p>

<p>But it is not more beautiful than useful. Its leaves, fruit, and stem,
are all put to some use in the domestic economy of the Indians. The
leaf-stalk, when dried, is light and elastic, like the quill of a bird&mdash;owing
to the thin, hard, outer covering and soft internal pith. Out
of the outer rind, when split off, the Indian makes baskets and
window-blinds. The pithy part is separated into laths, about half an
inch thick, with which window-shutters, boxes, bird-cages, partitions,
and even entire walls, are constructed.</p>

<p>The epidermis of the leaves furnishes the strings for hammocks and
all kinds of cordage. From the fruits a favourite beverage is produced,
and these fruits are also pleasant eating, somewhat resembling apples.
They are in appearance like pine-cones, of a red colour outside and
yellow pulp. The trunk itself furnishes a pith or marrow that can be
used as sago; and out of the wood the Indian cuts his buoyant canoe!
In short, there are tribes of Indians that not only live, in a literal
sense, <i>on</i> the murichi palms, but that almost subsist on them.</p>

<p>Although the flood had, to a considerable extent, subsided, the river
in most places was still beyond its banks; and this made it difficult
for our travellers to find a place for their night-camps. Several nights
they were obliged to sleep, as they best could, on the balza,&mdash;the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
being secured to a tree. Sometimes, by pushing some distance up the
mouth of an &ldquo;igarip&eacute;,&rdquo; or creek, they were able to find dry ground,
on which to encamp. During their passage through this labyrinth of
rivers, they travelled but very slowly, and their provisions were fast
running out. There was no chance for increasing their stock, as they
could not find either wild-hogs (peccaries) or capivaras. These
creatures, although they can swim well enough, would only be found
upon the banks of the river, when it returned within its proper
channel.</p>

<p>Now and then Guapo brought down a parrot, a macaw, or an aracari,
with his blow-gun; but these were only temporary supplies. They
had often heard howling monkeys in the trees, but had not been able
to see them; and none of the party would have refused to eat roast-monkey
now, as they had all tried it and found it quite palatable.
Guapo, blow-gun in hand, was continually peering up among the tree-tops
in search of monkeys or other game. He was, at length, rewarded
for his vigilance.</p>

<p>One night they had pushed the balza up an &ldquo;igarip&eacute;&rdquo; for a hundred
yards or so, where a dry bank gave them an opportunity of landing.
The creek itself was not much wider than the balza, and tall trees
stood upon both banks. In one or two places the thorny &ldquo;jacitara&rdquo;
palm&mdash;which is a sort of climbing plant, often hanging over the
branches of other trees&mdash;nearly reached across the stream. These
curious palms had even to be cautiously pushed to one side as the balza
passed,&mdash;for the arrowy claws upon them, if once hooked into the
clothes of passengers, would either have dragged the latter from off
the raft, or have torn out the piece of cloth.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE ARAGUATOES.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>ur party had passed several of these jacitaras, made the balza fast,
landed, and were just cooking their scanty supper, when they heard
a band of howling monkeys afar off in the woods. There was nothing
unusual in this; for these creatures are heard at all times among the
forests of the Amazon, especially at sunrise and before sunset, or
whenever there is any appearance of the approach of a rain-storm.</p>

<p>Our travellers would not have noticed their voices on this occasion,
but that they seemed to be approaching in that direction; and as
they were coming along the bank of the main river, Guapo concluded
that on arriving at the &ldquo;igarip&eacute;&rdquo; they would turn up it and pass near
where the balza was, and thus he might have them within reach of
his gravat&aacute;na. It was certain they were coming down the river side&mdash;of
course upon the tree-tops, and would, no doubt, turn up as Guapo
expected, for the trees on the opposite side of the igarip&eacute; stood too
far apart even for monkeys to spring across.</p>

<p>After waiting for half-an-hour or so, the hideous howling of the
monkeys could be heard at no great distance, and they were taking
the desired route. In fact, in a few minutes after, the troop appeared
upon some tall trees that stood on the edge of the creek, not fifty
yards from where the balza was moored. They were large animals,
of that lanky and slender shape that characterises the prehensile-tailed
monkeys; but these were different from the <i>ateles</i> already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
mentioned. They were true howlers, as they had already proved by
the cries they had been uttering for the half-hour past.</p>

<p>There are several species of howling monkeys, as we have already
stated. Those that had arrived on the igarip&eacute; Guapo pronounced to
be <i>araguatoes</i>. Their bodies are of a reddish-brown colour on the
body and shoulders, lighter underneath, and their naked wrinkled
faces are of a bluish black, and with very much of the expression of
an old man. Their hair is full and bushy, and gives them some
resemblance to a bear, whence their occasional name of &ldquo;bear-ape,&rdquo;
and also their zoological designation, <i>Simia ursina</i>. The araguato is
full three feet without the tail, and that powerful member is much
longer.</p>

<p>When the band made its appearance on the igarip&eacute;, they were seen
to come to a halt, all of them gathering into a great tree that stood
by the water's edge. This tree rose higher than the rest, and the
most of the monkeys having climbed among the top branches, were
visible from the balza. There were about fifty in the troop, and one
that seemed larger than any of the others appeared to act as leader.
Many of them were females, and there were not a few that had young
ones, which they carried upon their backs just as the Indian mothers
and those of other savage nations carry their children.</p>

<p>Most of the little monkeys lay along the backs of their mothers,
clasping them around the neck with their fore-arms, while their hind
ones girdled the middle of the body. But it was in their tails the
little fellows seemed to place most reliance. The top parts of these
were firmly lapped around the thick base of the tails of the old ones,
and thus not only secured their seat, but made it quite impossible for
them to drop off. No force could have shaken them from this hold,
without dragging out their tails or tearing their bodies to pieces,
indeed, it was necessary they should be thus firmly seated, as the
exertions of the mothers,&mdash;their quick motions and long springing
leaps from tree to tree&mdash;would otherwise have been impossible.</p>

<p>On reaching the bank of the igarip&eacute;, the araguatoes were evidently
at fault. Their intention had been to proceed down along the main
river, and the creek now interfered. Its water lay directly across
their course, and how were they to get over it? Swim it, you may,
say. Ha! little do you know the dread these creatures have of water.
Yes; strange to say, although many species of them pass their lives
upon trees that overhang water, or even grow out of it, they are as
much afraid of the water beneath them as if it were fire. A cat is not
half so dainty about wetting her feet as some monkeys are; and
besides a cat can swim, which the monkeys cannot&mdash;at best so badly
that in a few minutes they would drown.</p>

<p>Strange, is it not, that among animals, those that approach nearest
to man, like him are not gifted by nature with the power of swimming?
It is evident, then, that that is an art left to be discovered
by the intellect of man. To fall into the water would be a sad mishap
for a monkey, not only on account of the ducking, but of the danger.
There is not much likelihood of an araguato falling in. Even though
one branch may have broken and failed it, in the great concave
sphere which it can so quickly trace around it by means of its five
long members, it is sure of finding a second. No; the araguatoes
might spend a life-time in the flooded forest without even wetting a
hair farther than what is wetted by the rain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>

<p>From their movements, it was evident the igarip&eacute; had puzzled them;
and a consultation was called among the branches of the tall tree
already mentioned. Upon one of the very highest sat the large old
fellow who was evidently leader of the band. His harangue was loud
and long, accompanied by many gestures of his hands, head, and tail.
It was, no doubt, exceedingly eloquent. Similar speeches delivered
by other old araguato chiefs, have been compared to the creaking of
an ungreased bullock-cart, mingled with the rumbling of the wheels!</p>

<p>Our party thought the comparison a just one. The old chief finished
at length. Up to this point not one of the others had said a word.
They all sat silent, observing perfect decorum; indeed, much greater
than is observed in the great British Parliament or the Congress of
America. Occasionally one of the children might utter a slight
squeak, or throw out its hand to catch a mosquito; but in such cases
a slap from the paw of the mother, or a rough shaking, soon reduced
it to quiet.</p>

<p>When the chief had ended speaking, however, no debate in either
Congress or Parliament could have equalled the noise that then arose.
Every araguato seemed to have something to say, and all spoke at
the same time. If the speech of the old one was like the creaking of
a bullock-cart, the voices of all combined might appropriately be
compared to a whole string of these vehicles, with half the quantity
of grease and a double allowance of wheels!</p>

<p>Once more the chief, by a sign, commanded silence, and the rest
became mute and motionless as before.</p>

<p>This time the speech of the leader appeared to refer to the business
in hand&mdash;in short, to the crossing of the igarip&eacute;. He was seen repeatedly
pointing in that direction, as he spoke, and the rest followed
his motions with their eyes.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">BRIDGING AN IGARIP&Eacute;.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he tree upon which the araguatoes were assembled stood near the
edge of the water, but there was another still nearer. This was also
a tall tree free of branches for a great way up. On the opposite bank
of the igarip&eacute; was a very similar tree, and the long horizontal branches
of the two were separated from each other by a space of about twenty
feet. It was with these two trees that the attention of the araguatoes
appeared to be occupied; and our travellers could tell by their looks
and gestures that they were conversing about, and calculating, the
distance between their upper branches. For what purpose?</p>

<p>Surely they do not expect to be able to make a crossing between
them? No creature without wings could pass from one to the other!
Such were the questions and doubts expressed by Leon, and indeed
by all except Guapo, but Guapo had seen araguatoes before, and knew
some of their tricks. Guapo, therefore, boldly pronounced that it
was their intention to cross the igarip&eacute; by these two trees. He was
about to explain the manner in which they would accomplish it, when
the movement commenced, and rendered his explanation quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>At a commanding cry from the chief, several of the largest and
strongest monkeys swung themselves into the tree that stood on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
edge of the water. Here, after a moment's reconnoissance, they were
seen to get upon a horizontal limb&mdash;one that projected diagonally
over the igarip&eacute;. There were no limbs immediately underneath it on
the same side of the tree; and for this very reason had they selected
it. Having advanced until they were near its top, the foremost of the
monkeys let himself down upon his tail, and hung head downward.
Another slipped down the body of the first, and clutched him around
the neck and fore-arms with his strong tail, with his head down also.
A third succeeded the second, and a fourth the third, and so on until
a string of monkeys dangled from the limb.</p>

<p>A motion was now produced by the monkeys striking other branches
with their feet, until the long string oscillated back and forwards like
the pendulum of a clock. This oscillation was gradually increased,
until the monkey at the lower end was swung up among the branches
of the tree on the opposite side of the igarip&eacute;. After touching them
once or twice, he discovered that he was within reach; and the next
time when he had reached the highest point of the oscillating curve,
he threw out his long thin fore-arms, and firmly clutching the
branches, held fast.</p>

<p>The oscillation now ceased. The living chain stretched across the
igarip&eacute; from tree to tree, and, curving slightly, hung like a suspension-bridge!
A loud screaming, and gabbling, and chattering, and
howling, proceeded from the band of araguatoes, who, up to this
time, had watched the man&#339;uvres of their comrades in silence&mdash;all
except the old chief, who occasionally had given directions both with
voice and gestures. But the general gabble that succeeded was, no
doubt, an expression of the satisfaction of all that the <i>bridge was
built</i>.</p>

<p>The troop now proceeded to cross over, one or two old ones going
first, perhaps to try the strength of the bridge. Then went the
mothers carrying their young on their backs, and after them the
rest of the band.</p>

<p>It was quite an amusing scene to witness, and the behaviour of
the monkeys would have caused any one to laugh. Even Guapo
could not restrain his mirth at seeing those who formed the bridge
biting the others that passed over them, both on the legs and tails,
until the latter screamed again!</p>

<p>The old chief stood at the near end and directed the crossing.
Like a brave officer, he was the last to pass over. When all the
others had preceded him, he crossed after, carrying himself in a
stately and dignified manner. None dared to bite at <i>his</i> legs. They
knew better than play off their tricks on <i>him</i>, and he crossed quietly
and without any molestation.</p>

<p>Now the string still remained suspended between the trees. How
were the monkeys that formed it to get themselves free again? Of
course the one that had clutched the branch with his arms might
easily let go, but that would bring them back to the same side from
which they had started, and would separate them from the rest of
the band. Those constituting the bridge would, therefore, be as far
from crossing as ever!</p>

<p>There seemed to be a difficulty here&mdash;that is, to some of our
travellers. To the monkeys themselves there was none. They knew
well enough what they were about, and they would have got over
the apparent difficulty in the following manner:&mdash;The one at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
tail end of the bridge would simply have let go his hold, and the
whole string would then have swung over and hung from the tree on
the opposite bank, into which they could have climbed at their
leisure. I say they <i>would</i> have done so had nothing interfered to
prevent them from completing the man&#339;uvre. But an obstacle
intervened which brought the affair to a very different termination.</p>

<p>Guapo had been seated along with the rest, gravat&aacute;na in hand.
He showed great forbearance in not having used the gravat&aacute;na long
before, for he was all the while quite within reach of the araguatoes;
but this forbearance on his part was not of his own freewill. Don
Pablo had, in fact, hindered him, in order that he and the others,
should have an opportunity of witnessing the singular man&#339;uvres of
the monkeys. Before the scene was quite over, however, the Indian
begged Don Pablo to let him shoot, reminding him how much they
stood in need of a little &ldquo;monkey-meat.&rdquo; This had the effect Guapo
desired; the consent was given, and the gravat&aacute;na was pointed
diagonally upwards. Once more Guapo's cheeks were distended&mdash;once
more came the strong, quick puff&mdash;and away went the arrow.
The next moment it was seen sticking in the neck of one of the
monkeys.</p>

<p>Now, the one which Guapo had aimed at and hit was that which
had grasped the tree on the opposite side with its arms. Why did
he chose this more than any other? Was it because it was nearer, or
more exposed to view? Neither of these was the reason. It was,
that had he shot any of the others in the string&mdash;they being supported
by their tails&mdash;it would not have fallen; the tail, as we have
already seen, still retaining its prehensile power even to death. But
that one which held on to the tree by its fore-arms would in a second
or two be compelled from weakness to let go, and the whole chain
would drop back on the near side of the igarip&eacute;. This was just what
Guapo desired, and he waited for the result. It was necessary only
to wait half-a-dozen seconds. The monkey was evidently growing
weak under the influence of the <i>curare</i>, and was struggling to retain
its hold. In a moment it must let go.</p>

<p>The araguato at the &ldquo;tail-end&rdquo; of the bridge, not knowing what
had happened, and thinking all was right for swinging himself
across, slipped his tail from the branch just at the very same instant
that the wounded one let go, and the whole chain fell &ldquo;souse&rdquo; into
the water! Then the screaming and howling from those on shore,
the plunging and splashing of the monkeys in the stream, mingled
with the shouts of Leon, Guapo, and the others, created a scene of
noise and confusion that lasted for several minutes. In the midst
of it, Guapo threw himself into the canoe, and with a single stroke
of his paddle shot right down among the drowning monkeys. One or
two escaped to the bank, and made off; several went to the bottom;,
but three, including the wounded one, fell into the clutches of the
hunter.</p>

<p>Of course roast-monkey was added to the supper; but none of the
travellers slept very well after it, as the araguatoes, lamenting their
lost companions, kept up a most dismal wailing throughout the
whole of the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE MANATI.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he araguatoes, with dried plantains and cassava, were the food of
our travellers for several days after. On the evening of the third
day they had a change. Guapo succeeded in capturing a very large
turtle, which served for relish at several meals. His mode of taking
the turtle was somewhat curious, and deserves to be described.</p>

<p>The balza had been brought to the bank, and they were just
mooring it, when something out on the water attracted the attention
of Leon and Leona. It was a small, darkish object, and would not
have been observed but for the ripple that it made on the smooth
surface of the river, and by this they could tell that it was in motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A water-snake!&rdquo; said Leon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; ejaculated the little Leona, &ldquo;I hope not, brother Leon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On second thoughts,&rdquo; replied Leon, &ldquo;I don't think it is a snake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course the object was a good distance off, else Leon and Leona
would not have talked so coolly about it. But their words had
reached the ear of Do&ntilde;a Isidora, and drawn her attention to what
they were talking about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; it is not a snake,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I fancy it is a turtle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guapo up to this had been busy with Don Pablo in getting the
balza made fast. The word &ldquo;turtle,&rdquo; however, caught his ear at
once, and he looked up, and then out on the river in the direction
where Leon and Leona were pointing. As soon as his eye rested
upon the moving object he replied to the remark of Do&ntilde;a Isidora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my mistress,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is a turtle, and a big one too.
Please all keep quiet&mdash;I think I can get him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How Guapo was to get the turtle was a mystery to all. The
latter was about thirty paces distant, but it would be difficult, if not
impossible, to hit his small snout&mdash;the only part above water&mdash;with
the arrow of the blow-gun. Moreover, they thought that the arrow
would not penetrate the hard, bony substance, so as to stick there
and infuse its poison into the wound.</p>

<p>These conjectures were true enough, but his gravat&aacute;na was not
the weapon which Guapo was about to use. He had other weapons
as well&mdash;a fish-spear or harpoon, and a regular bow and arrows,
which he had made during his leisure hours in the valley.</p>

<p>The latter was the weapon with which the tortoise was to be killed.</p>

<p>Taking the bow, and adjusting an arrow to the string, Guapo
stepped forward to the water's edge. All watched him, uttering
their hopes of his success. It was still not clear with them how
the turtle was to be killed by an arrow shot from a bow any more
than by one sent from a blow-gun. Would it not glance from the
shell even should he succeed in hitting it under water! Surely it
would!</p>

<p>As they stood whispering their conjectures to one another, they
observed Guapo, to their great astonishment, <i>pointing his arrow
upward</i>, and making as if he was going to discharge it in the air!
This he, in fact, <i>did</i> do a moment after; and they would have
been puzzled by his apparently strange conduct, had they not observed,
in the next instant, that the arrow, after flying high up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
came down again head-foremost and stuck upright in the back of the
turtle!</p>

<p>The turtle dived at once, and all of them expected to see the
upright arrow carried under water. What was their surprise as well
as chagrin to see that it had fallen out, and was floating on the
surface! Of course the wound had only been a slight one, and the
turtle would escape, and be none the worse for it.</p>

<p>But Guapo shared neither their surprise nor chagrin. Guapo felt
sure that the turtle was his, and said nothing; but, jumping into
the canoe, began to paddle himself out to where the creature had
been last seen. What could he be after? thought they.</p>

<p>As they watched him, they saw that he made for the floating
arrow. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;he is gone to recover it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That seemed probable enough, but, to their astonishment, as he
approached the weapon it took a start, and ran away from him!
Something below dragged it along the water. That was clear, and
they began to comprehend the mystery. The <i>head</i> of the arrow was
still sticking in the shell of the turtle. It was only the shaft that
floated, and that was attached to the head by a string! The latter
had been but loosely put on, so that the pressure of the water, as
the turtle dived, should separate it from the shaft, leaving the shaft
with its cord to act as a buoy, and discover the situation of the turtle.</p>

<p>Guapo, in his swift canoe, soon laid hold of the shaft, and after
a little careful man&#339;uvring, succeeded in landing his turtle high and
dry upon the bank. A splendid prize it proved. It was a &ldquo;jurara&rdquo;
tortoise&mdash;the &ldquo;tataruga,&rdquo; or great turtle of the Portuguese, and its
shell was full three feet in diameter.</p>

<p>Guapo's mode of capturing the &ldquo;jurara&rdquo; is the same as that
generally practised by the Indians of the Amazon, although strong
nets and the hook are also used. The arrow is always discharged
upwards, and the range calculated with such skill, that it falls
vertically on the shell of the turtle, and penetrates deep enough
to stick, and detach itself from the shaft. This mode of shooting
is necessary, else the jurara could not be killed by an arrow, because
it never shows more than the tip of its snout above water, and any
arrow hitting it in a direct course would glance harmlessly from its
shell. A good bowman among the Indians will rarely miss shooting
in this way,&mdash;long practice and native skill enabling him to guess
within an inch of where his weapon will fall.</p>

<p>In the towns of the Lower Amazon, where turtles are brought to
market, a small square hole may be observed in the shells of these
creatures. That is the mark of the arrow-head.</p>

<p>Guapo lost no time in turning his turtle inside out, and converting
part of it into a savoury supper, while the remainder was fried into
sausage-meat, and put away for the following day.</p>

<p>But on that following day a much larger stock of sausage-meat
was procured from a very different animal, and that was a &ldquo;cow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; you exclaim,&mdash;&ldquo;a cow in the wild forests of the Amazon!
Why, you have said that no cattle&mdash;either cows or horses&mdash;can exist
there without man to protect them, else they would be devoured by
pumas, jaguars, and bats. Perhaps they had arrived at some
settlement where cows were kept?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not a bit of it; your conjecture, my young friend, is quite astray.
There was not a civilised settlement for many hundreds of miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
from where Guapo got his cow&mdash;nor a cow neither, of the sort you
are thinking of. But there are more kinds of cows than one; and,
perhaps, you may have heard of a creature called the &ldquo;fish-cow?&rdquo;
Well, that is the sort of cow I am speaking of. Some term it the
&ldquo;sea-cow,&rdquo; but this is an improper name for it, since it also inhabits
fresh-water rivers throughout all tropical America. It is known as
the <i>Manati</i>, and the Portuguese call it &ldquo;<i>peixe boi</i>,&rdquo; which is only
&ldquo;fish-cow&rdquo; done into Portuguese.</p>

<p>It is a curious creature the fish-cow, and I shall offer you a short
description of it. It is usually about seven feet in length, and five
round the thickest part of the body, which latter is quite smooth,
and tapers off into a horizontal flat tail, semicircular in shape.
There are no hind-limbs upon the animal, but just behind the head
are two powerful fins of an oval shape. There is no neck to be
perceived; and the head, which is not very large, terminates in
a large mouth and fleshy lips, which are not unlike those of a cow:
hence its name of &ldquo;cow-fish.&rdquo; There are stiff bristles on the upper
lip, and a few thinly scattered hairs over the rest of the body.
Behind the oval fins are two <i>mamm&aelig;</i>, or breasts, from which, when
pressed, flows a stream of beautiful white milk. Both eyes and ears
are very small in proportion to the size of the animal, but, nevertheless,
it has full use of these organs, and is not easily approached
by its enemy.</p>

<p>The colour of the skin is a dusky lead, with some flesh-coloured
marks on the belly, and the skin itself is an inch thick at its thickest
part, on the back. Beneath the skin is a layer of fat, of great,
thickness, which makes excellent oil when boiled. As we have said,
the manati has no appearance of hind-limbs. Its fore-limbs, however,
are highly developed for a water animal. The bones in them
correspond to those in the human arm, having five fingers with the
joints distinct, yet so enclosed in an inflexible sheath that not a joint
can be moved.</p>

<p>The cow-fish feeds on grass, coming in to the borders of the lakes
and rivers to procure it. It can swim very rapidly by means of its
flat tail and strong fins, and is not so easily captured as might be
supposed. All the art of the hunter is required to effect its destruction.
The harpoon is the weapon usually employed, though sometimes
they are caught in strong nets stretched across the mouths of
rivers or the narrow arms of lakes. The flesh of the manati is much
esteemed, and tastes somewhat between beef and pork, altogether
different from &ldquo;fish.&rdquo; Fried in its own oil, and poured into pots or
jars, it can be preserved for many months.</p>

<p>As already stated, on the day after Guapo shot the turtle&mdash;in fact,
the next morning&mdash;just as they were going to shove off, some of the
party, in gazing from the edge of the balza, noticed a queer-looking
animal in the clear water below. It was no other than a &ldquo;fish-cow;&rdquo;
and, as they continued to examine it more attentively, they were
astonished to observe that, with its short paddle-like limbs, it
hugged two miniature models of itself close to its two breasts.
These were the &ldquo;calves&rdquo; in the act of suckling, for such is the mode
in which the manati nourishes her young.</p>

<p>All the others would have watched this spectacle for a while,
interested in the maternal and filial traits thus exhibited by a
subaqueous creature, but while they stood looking into the water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
something glanced before their eyes, and glided with a plunge to
the bottom. It was the harpoon of Guapo.</p>

<p>Blood rose to the surface immediately, and there was a considerable
splashing as the strong manati made its attempt to escape; but
the head of the harpoon was deeply buried in its flesh, and, with the
attached cord, Guapo soon hauled the animal ashore. It was as
much as he and Don Pablo could do to drag it on dry land; but the
knife soon took it to pieces; and then several hours were spent in
making it fit for preservation. Its fat and flesh yielded enough to
fill every spare vessel our travellers had got; and, when all were
filled, the balza was pushed off, and they continued their voyage
without any fear of short rations for some time to come.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER L.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE CLOSING CHAPTER.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span>fter many days of difficult navigation the balza floated upon the
broad and mighty Amazon, whose yellowish-olive flood flowed yet
fifteen hundred miles farther to the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>The current was in most places over four miles an hour, and the
navigation smooth and easy&mdash;so that our travellers rarely made less
than fifty miles a-day. There was considerable monotony in the
landscape, on account of the absence of mountains, as the Amazon,
through most of its course, runs through a level plain. The numerous
bends and sudden windings of the stream, however, continually
opening out into new and charming vistas, and the ever-changing
variety of vegetation, formed sources of delight to the travellers.</p>

<p>Almost every day they passed the mouth of some tributary river&mdash;many
of these appearing as large as the Amazon itself. Our travellers
were struck with a peculiarity in relation to these rivers&mdash;that is,
their variety of colour. Some were whitish, with a tinge of olive,
like the Amazon itself; others were blue and transparent; while
a third kind had waters as black as ink. Of the latter class is the
great river of the Rio Negro&mdash;which by means of a tributary (the
Cassiquiare) joins the Amazon with the Orinoco.</p>

<p>Indeed, the rivers of the Amazon valley have been classed into
<i>white</i>, <i>blue</i>, and <i>black</i>. <i>Red</i> rivers, such as are common in the northern
division of the American continent, do not exist in the valley of the
Amazon.</p>

<p>There appears to be no other explanation for this difference in the
colour of rivers, except by supposing that they take their hue from
the nature of the soil through which these channels run.</p>

<p>But the <i>white</i> rivers, as the Amazon itself, do not appear to be of
this hue merely because they are &ldquo;muddy.&rdquo; On the contrary, they
derive their colour, or most of it, from some impalpable substance
held in a state of irreducible solution. This is proved from the fact,
that even when these waters enter a reservoir, and the earthy matter
is allowed to settle, they still retain the same tinge of yellowish olive.
There are some white rivers, as the Rio Branco, whose waters are
almost as white as milk itself!</p>

<p>The <i>blue</i> rivers of the Amazon valley are those with clear transparent
waters, and the courses of these lie through rocky countries where
there is little or no alluvium to render them turbid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>black</i> streams are the most remarkable of all. These, when deep,
look like rivers of ink; and when the bottom can be seen, which is
usually a sandy one, the sand has the appearance of gold. Even when
lifted in a vessel, the water retains its inky tinge, and resembles that
which may be found in the pools of peat-bogs. It is a general supposition
in South America that the black-water rivers get their colour
from the extract of sarsaparilla roots growing on their banks. It is
possible the sarsaparilla roots may have something to do with it, in
common with both the roots and leaves of many other vegetables. No
other explanation has yet been found to account for the dark colour
of these rivers, except the decay of vegetable substances carried in
their current; and it is a fact that all the black-water streams run
through the most thickly wooded regions.</p>

<p>A curious fact may be mentioned of the black rivers; that is, that
mosquitoes&mdash;the plague of tropical America&mdash;are not found on their
banks. This is not only a curious, but an important fact, and might
be sufficient to determine any one on the choice of a settlement. You
may deem a mosquito a very small thing, and its presence a trifling
annoyance. Let me tell you that settlements have been broken up
and deserted on account of the persecution experienced from these
little insects! They are the real &ldquo;wild beasts&rdquo; of South America, far
more to be dreaded than pumas, or crocodiles, or snakes, or even the
fierce jaguar himself.</p>

<p>Day after day our travellers kept on their course, meeting with
many incidents and adventures&mdash;too many to be recorded in this little
volume. After passing the mouth of the Rio Negro, they began to
get a peep now and then of high land, and even mountains, in the
distance; for the valley of the Amazon, on approaching its mouth,
assumes a different character from what it has farther up-stream.
These mountains bend towards it both from the Brazilian country on
the south, and from Guiana on the north, and these are often visible
from the bosom of the stream itself.</p>

<p>It was about a month from their entering the main stream of the
Amazon, and a little more than two from the first launching of their
vessel, when the balza was brought alongside the wharf of Grand Para,
and Don Pablo and his party stepped on shore at this Brazilian town.
Here, of course, Don Pablo was a free man&mdash;free to go where he pleased&mdash;free
to dispose of his cargo as he thought best. But he did <i>not</i> dispose
of it at Grand Para.</p>

<p>A better plan presented itself. He was enabled to freight part of a
vessel starting for New York, and thither he went, taking his family
and cargo along with him. In New York he obtained a large price
for his bark, roots, and beans; in fact, when all were disposed of, he
found himself nearly twenty thousand dollars to the good. With this
to live upon, he determined to remain in the great Republic of the
North until such time as his own dear Peru might be freed from the
Spanish oppressor.</p>

<p>Ten years was the period of his exile. At the end of that time the
Spanish-American provinces struck almost simultaneously for liberty;
and in the ten years' struggle that followed, not only Don Pablo, but
Leon&mdash;now a young man&mdash;bore a conspicuous part. Both fought by
the side of Bolivar at the great battle of Junin, which crowned the
patriot army with victory.</p>

<p>At the close of the War of Independence, Don Pablo was a general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
of division, while Leon had reached the grade of a colonel. But as
soon as the fighting was over, both resigned their military rank, as
they were men who did not believe in soldiering as a <i>mere profession</i>.
In fact, they regarded it as an unbecoming profession in time of peace,
and in this view <i>I</i> quite agree with them.</p>

<p>Don Pablo returned to his studies; but Leon organised an expedition
of <i>cascarilleros</i>, and returned to the Monta&ntilde;a, where for many
years he employed himself in &ldquo;bark-hunting.&rdquo; Through this he became
one of the richest of Peruvian &ldquo;ricos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guapo, who at this time did not look a year older than when first
introduced, was as tough and sinewy as ever, and was at the head of
the cascarilleros; and many a <i>coceada</i> did Guapo afterwards enjoy
with his mountain friend the &ldquo;vaquero&rdquo; while passing backward and
forward between Cuzco and the Monta&ntilde;a.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Isidora lived for a long period an ornament to her sex, and
the little Leona had <i>her</i> day as the &ldquo;belle of Cuzco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Leon and Leona both got married at length; and were you to
visit Cuzco at the present time, you might see several little Leons
and Leonas, with round black eyes, and dark waving hair&mdash;all of
them descendants from our family of&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE BOERS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">H</span>endrik Von Bloom was a <i>boer</i>.</p>

<p>When I called Hendrik Von Bloom a boer, I did not mean him
any disrespect. Quite the contrary.</p>

<p>All the same it may be well to explain that Mynheer Hendrik had
not always been a boer. He could boast of a somewhat higher
condition&mdash;that is, he could boast of a better education than the
mere Cape farmer usually possesses, as well as some experience in
wielding the sword. He was not a native of the colony, but of
Holland; and he had found his way to the Cape, not as a poor
adventurer seeking his fortune, but as an officer in a Dutch regiment
then stationed there.</p>

<p>His soldier-service in the colony was not of long duration. A
certain cherry-cheeked, flaxen-haired Gertrude&mdash;the daughter of a
rich boer&mdash;had taken a liking to the young lieutenant; and he in
his turn became vastly fond of her. The consequence was, that they
got married. Gertrude's father dying shortly after, the large farm,
with its full stock of horses, and Hottentots, broad-tailed sheep, and
long-horned oxen, became hers. This was an inducement for her
soldier-husband to lay down the sword and turn &ldquo;vee-boer,&rdquo; or
stock farmer, which he consequently did.</p>

<p>These incidents occurred many years previous to the English becoming
masters of the Cape colony. When that event came to pass,
Hendrik Von Bloom was already a man of influence in the colony
and &ldquo;field-cornet&rdquo; of his district, which lay in the beautiful county
of Graaf Reinet. He was then a widower, the father of a small
family. The wife whom he had fondly loved,&mdash;the cherry-cheeked,
flaxen-haired Gertrude&mdash;no longer lived.</p>

<p>History will tell you how the Dutch colonists, discontented with
English rule, rebelled against it. The ex-lieutenant and field-cornet
was one of the most prominent among these rebels. History will
also tell you how the rebellion was put down; and how several of
those compromised were brought to execution. Von Bloom escaped
by flight; but his fine property in the Graaf Reinet was confiscated
and given to another.</p>

<p>Many years after we find him living in a remote district beyond
the great Orange River, leading the life of a &ldquo;trek-boer,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a
nomade farmer, who has no fixed or permanent abode, but moves
with his flocks from place to place, wherever good pastures and water
may tempt him.</p>

<p>From about this time dates my knowledge of the field-cornet and
his family. Of his history previous to this I have stated all I know,
but for a period of many years after I am more minutely acquainted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
with it. Most of its details I received from the lips of his own son.
I was greatly interested, and indeed instructed, by them. They were
my first lessons in African zoology.</p>

<p>Believing, boy reader, that they might also instruct and interest
you, I here lay them before you. You are not to regard them as
merely fanciful. The descriptions of the wild creatures that play
their parts in this little history, as well as the acts, habits, and
instincts assigned to them, you may regard as true to Nature. Young
Von Bloom was a student of Nature, and you may depend upon the
fidelity of his descriptions.</p>

<p>Disgusted with politics, the field-cornet now dwelt on the remote
frontier&mdash;in fact, beyond the frontier, for the nearest settlement was
an hundred miles off. His &ldquo;kraal&rdquo; was in a district bordering the
great Kalihari desert&mdash;the Sa&auml;ra of Southern Africa. The region
around, for hundreds of miles, was uninhabited, for the thinly-scattered,
half-human Bushmen who dwelt within its limits, hardly
deserved the name of inhabitants any more than the wild beasts that
howled around them.</p>

<p>I have said that Von Bloom now followed the occupation of a
&ldquo;trek-boer.&rdquo; Farming in the Cape colony consists principally in the
rearing of horses, cattle, sheep, and goats; and these animals form
the wealth of the boer. But the stock of our field-cornet was now a
very small one. The proscription had swept away all his wealth,
and he had not been fortunate in his first essays as a nomade grazier.
The emancipation law, passed by the British Government, extended
not only to the Negroes of the West India Islands, but also to the
Hottentots of the Cape; and the result of it was that the servants of
Mynheer Von Bloom had deserted him. His cattle, no longer
properly cared for, had strayed off. Some of them fell a prey to wild
beasts&mdash;some died of the <i>murrain</i>. His horses, too, were decimated
by that mysterious disease of Southern Africa, the &ldquo;horse-sickness;&rdquo;
while his sheep and goats were continually being attacked and
diminished in numbers by the earth-wolf, the wild hound, and the
hyena. A series of losses had he suffered until his horses, oxen,
sheep, and goats, scarce counted altogether an hundred head. A
very small stock for a vee-boer, or South African grazier.</p>

<p>Withal our field-cornet was not unhappy. He looked around upon
his three brave sons&mdash;Hans, Hendrik, and Jan. He looked upon his
cherry-cheeked, flaxen-haired daughter, Gertrude, the very type and
image of what her mother had been. From these he drew the hope
of a happier future.</p>

<p>His two eldest boys were already helps to him in his daily occupations;
the youngest would soon be so likewise. In Gertrude,&mdash;or
&ldquo;Tr&uuml;ey,&rdquo; as she was endearingly styled,&mdash;he would soon have a
capital housekeeper. He was not unhappy therefore; and if an
occasional sigh escaped him, it was when the face of little Tr&uuml;ey
recalled the memory of that Gertrude who was now in heaven.</p>

<p>But Hendrik Von Bloom was not the man to despair. Disappointments
had not succeeded in causing his spirits to droop. He only
applied himself more ardently to the task of once more building up
his fortune.</p>

<p>For himself he had no ambition to be rich. He would have been
contented with the simple life he was leading, and would have cared
but little to increase his wealth. But other considerations weighed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
upon his mind&mdash;the future of his little family. He could not suffer
his children to grow up in the midst of the wild plains without
education.</p>

<p>No; they must one day return to the abodes of men, to act their
part in the drama of social and civilised life. This was his design.</p>

<p>But how was this design to be accomplished? Though his so called
act of treason had been pardoned, and he was now free to return
within the limits of the colony, he was ill prepared for such a purpose.
His poor wasted stock would not suffice to set him up within
the settlements. It would scarce keep him a month. To return
would be to return a beggar!</p>

<p>Reflections of this kind sometimes gave him anxiety. But they
also added energy to his disposition, and rendered him more eager
to overcome the obstacles before him.</p>

<p>During the present year he had been very industrious. In order
that his cattle should be provided for in the season of winter he had
planted a large quantity of maize and buckwheat, and now the crops
of both were in the most prosperous condition. His garden, too,
smiled, and promised a profusion of fruits, and melons, and kitchen
vegetables. In short, the little homestead where he had fixed himself
for a time, was a miniature o&auml;sis; and he rejoiced day after day,
as his eyes rested upon the ripening aspect around him. Once more
he began to dream of prosperity&mdash;once more to hope that his evil
fortunes had come to an end.</p>

<p>Alas! It was a false hope. A series of trials yet awaited him&mdash;a
series of misfortunes that deprived him of almost everything he possessed,
and completely changed his mode of existence.</p>

<p>Perhaps these occurrences could hardly be termed misfortunes,
since in the end they led to a happy result.</p>

<p>But you may judge for yourself, boy reader, after you have heard
the &ldquo;history and adventures&rdquo; of the &ldquo;trek-boer&rdquo; and his family.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE KRAAL.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he ex-field-cornet was seated in front of his <i>kraal</i>&mdash;for such is the
name of a South African homestead. From his lips protruded a large
pipe, with its huge bowl of <i>meerschaum</i>. Every boer is a smoker.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the many losses and crosses of his past life, there
was contentment in his eye. He was gratified by the prosperous
appearance of his crops. The maize was now &ldquo;in the milk,&rdquo; and the
ears, folded within the papyrus-like husks, looked full and large.
It was delightful to hear the rustling of the long green blades, and
see the bright golden tassels waving in the breeze. The heart of the
farmer was glad as his eye glanced over his promising crop of
&ldquo;mealies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was another promising crop that still more gladdened
his heart&mdash;his fine children. There they are&mdash;all around him.</p>

<p>Hans&mdash;the oldest&mdash;steady, sober Hans, at work in the well-stocked
garden; while the diminutive but sprightly imp Jan, the youngest,
is looking on, and occasionally helping his brother. Hendrik&mdash;the
dashing Hendrik, with bright face and light curling hair&mdash;is busy
among the horses, in the &ldquo;horse-kraal;&rdquo; and Tr&uuml;ey&mdash;the beautiful,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
cherry-cheeked, flaxen-haired Tr&uuml;ey&mdash;is engaged with her pet&mdash;a
fawn of the springbok gazelle&mdash;whose bright eyes rival her own in
their expression of innocence and loveliness.</p>

<p>Yes, the heart of the field-cornet is glad as he glances from one to
the other of these his children&mdash;and with reason. They are all fair
to look upon,&mdash;all give promise of goodness. If their father feels an
occasional pang, it is, as we have already said, when his eye rests
upon the cherry-cheeked, flaxen-haired Gertrude.</p>

<p>But time has long since subdued that grief to a gentle melancholy.
Its pang is short-lived, and the face of the field-cornet soon lightens
up again as he looks around upon his dear children, so full of hope
and promise.</p>

<p>Hans and Hendrik are already strong enough to assist him in his
occupations,&mdash;in fact, with the exception of &ldquo;Swartboy,&rdquo; they are
the only help he has.</p>

<p>Who is Swartboy?</p>

<p>Look into the horse-kraal, and you will there see Swartboy engaged,
along with his young master Hendrik, in saddling a pair of
horses. You may notice that Swartboy appears to be about thirty
years old, and he is full that; but if you were to apply a measuring
rule to him, you would find him not much over four feet in height!
He is stoutly built, however, and would measure better in a horizontal
direction. You may notice that he is of a yellow complexion,
although his name might lead you to fancy he was black&mdash;for
&ldquo;Swartboy&rdquo; means &ldquo;black-boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may observe that his nose is flat and sunk below the level of
his cheeks; that his cheeks are prominent, his lips very thick, his
nostrils wide, his face beardless, and his head almost hairless&mdash;for
the small kinky wool-knots thinly scattered over his skull can
scarcely be designated hair. You may notice, moreover, that his
head is monstrously large, with ears in proportion, and that the eyes
are set obliquely, and have a Chinese expression. You may notice
about Swartboy all those characteristics that distinguish the &ldquo;Hottentots&rdquo;
of South Africa.</p>

<p>Yet Swartboy is not a Hottentot&mdash;though he is of the same race.
He is a Bushman.</p>

<p>How came this wild Bushman into the service of the ex-field-cornet
Von Bloom? About that there is a little romantic history. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Among the savage tribes of Southern Africa there exists a very
cruel custom,&mdash;that of abandoning their aged or infirm, and often
their sick or wounded, to die in the desert. Children leave their
parents behind them, and the wounded are often forsaken by their
comrades with no other provision made for them beyond a day's food
and a cup of water!</p>

<p>The Bushman Swartboy had been the victim of this custom. He
had been upon a hunting excursion with some of his own kindred,
and had been sadly mangled by a lion. His comrades, not expecting
him to live, left him on the plain to die; and most certainly would
he have perished had it not been for our field-cornet. The latter, as
he was &ldquo;trekking&rdquo; over the plains, found the wounded Bushman,
lifted him into his wagon, carried him on to his camp, dressed his
wounds, and nursed him till he became well. That is how Swartboy
came to be in the service of the field-cornet.</p>

<p>Though gratitude is not a characteristic of his race, Swartboy was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
not ungrateful. When all the other servants ran away, he remained
faithful to his master; and since that time had been a most efficient
and useful hand. In fact, he was now the only one left, with the
exception of the girl, Totty&mdash;who was, of course, a Hottentot; and
much about the same height, size, and colour, as Swartboy himself.</p>

<p>We have said that Swartboy and the young Hendrik were saddling
a pair of horses. As soon as they had finished that job, they mounted
them, and riding out of the kraal, took their way straight across the
plain. They were followed by a couple of strong, rough-looking
dogs.</p>

<p>Their purpose was to drive home the oxen and the other horses
that were feeding a good distance off. This they were in the habit
of doing every evening at the same hour,&mdash;for in South Africa it is
necessary to shut up all kinds of live stock at night, to protect them
from beasts of prey. For this purpose are built several enclosures
with high walls,&mdash;&ldquo;kraals,&rdquo; as they are called,&mdash;a word of the same
signification as the Spanish &ldquo;corral,&rdquo; and I fancy introduced into
Africa by the Portuguese&mdash;since it is not a native term.</p>

<p>These kraals are important structures about the homestead of a
boer, almost as much so as his own dwelling-house, which of itself
also bears the name of &ldquo;kraal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As young Hendrik and Swartboy rode off for the horses and cattle,
Hans, leaving his work in the garden, proceeded to collect the sheep
and drive them home. These browsed in a different direction; but,
as they were near, he went afoot, taking little Jan along with him.</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey having tied her pet to a post, had gone inside the house to
help Totty in preparing the supper. Thus the field-cornet was left
to himself and his pipe, which he still continued to smoke.</p>

<p>He sat in perfect silence, though he could scarce restrain from
giving expression to the satisfaction he felt at seeing his family thus
industriously employed. Though pleased with all his children, it
must be confessed he had some little partiality for the dashing
Hendrik, who bore his own name, and who reminded him more of
his own youth than any of the others. He was proud of Hendrik's
gallant horsemanship, and his eyes followed him over the plain until
the riders were nearly a mile off, and already mixing among the
cattle.</p>

<p>At this moment an object came under the eyes of Von Bloom, that
at once arrested his attention. It was a curious appearance along
the lower part of the sky, in the direction in which Hendrik and
Swartboy had gone, but apparently beyond them. It resembled a
dun-coloured mist or smoke, as if the plain at a great distance was
on fire!</p>

<p>Could that be so? Had some one fired the <i>karoo</i> bushes? Or was
it a cloud of dust?</p>

<p>The wind was hardly strong enough to raise such a dust, and yet
it had that appearance. Was it caused by animals? Might it not
be the dust raised by a great herd of antelopes,&mdash;a migration of the
springboks, for instance? It extended for miles along the horizon,
but Von Bloom knew that these creatures often travel in flocks of
greater extent than miles. Still he could not think it was that.</p>

<p>He continued to gaze at the strange phenomenon, endeavouring to
account for it in various ways. It seemed to be rising higher against
the blue sky&mdash;now resembling dust, now like the smoke of a widely-spread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
conflagration, and now like a reddish cloud. It was in the
west, and already the setting sun was obscured by it. It had
passed over the sun's disc like a screen, and his light no longer fell
upon the plain. Was it the forerunner of some terrible storm?&mdash;of
an earthquake?</p>

<p>Such a thought crossed the mind of the field-cornet. It was not
like an ordinary cloud,&mdash;it was not like a cloud of dust,&mdash;it was not
like smoke. It was like nothing he had ever witnessed before. No
wonder that he became anxious and apprehensive.</p>

<p>All at once the dark-red mass seemed to envelope the cattle upon
the plain, and these could be seen running to and fro as if affrighted.
Then the two riders disappeared under its dun shadow!</p>

<p>Von Bloom rose to his feet, now seriously alarmed. What could
it mean?</p>

<p>The exclamation to which he gave utterance brought little Tr&uuml;ey
and Totty from the house; and Hans with Jan had now got back
with the sheep and goats. All saw the singular phenomenon, but
none of them could tell what it was. All were in a state of alarm.</p>

<p>As they stood gazing, with hearts full of fear, the two riders
appeared coming out of the cloud, and then they were seen to gallop
forward over the plain in the direction of the house. They came on
at full speed, but long before they had got near, the voice of Swartboy
could be heard crying out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baas Von Bloom! <i>da springaans are comin'!&mdash;da springaan!&mdash;da
springaan!</i>&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE SPRING-HAAN.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">&ldquo;A</span>h <i>the springaan</i>!&rdquo; cried Von Bloom, recognising the Dutch name
for the far-famed migratory locust.</p>

<p>The mystery was explained. The singular cloud that was spreading
itself over the plain was neither more nor less than a flight of
locusts!</p>

<p>It was a sight that none of them, except Swartboy, had ever
witnessed before. His master had often seen locusts in small quantities,
and of several species,&mdash;for there are many kinds of these
singular insects in South Africa. But that which now appeared was
a true migratory locust (<i>Gryllus devastatorius</i>); and upon one of its
great migrations&mdash;an event of rarer occurrence than travellers would
have you believe.</p>

<p>Swartboy knew them well; and, although he announced their
approach in a state of great excitement, it was not the excitement
of terror.</p>

<p>Quite the contrary. His great thick lips were compressed
athwart his face in a grotesque expression of joy. The instincts of
his wild race were busy within him. To them a flight of locusts
is not an object of dread, but a source of rejoicing&mdash;their coming
as welcome as a take of shrimps to a Leigh fisherman, or harvest to
the husband-man.</p>

<p>The dogs, too, barked and howled with joy, and frisked about
as if they were going out upon a hunt. On perceiving the cloud,
their instinct enabled them easily to recognise the locusts. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
regarded them with feelings similar to those that stirred Swartboy&mdash;for
both dogs and Bushmen eat the insects with avidity!</p>

<p>At the announcement that it was only locusts, all at once recovered
from their alarm. Little Tr&uuml;ey and Jan laughed, clapped their
hands, and waited with curiosity until they should come nearer.
All had heard enough of locusts to know that they were only
grasshoppers that neither bit nor stung any one, and therefore no
one was afraid of them.</p>

<p>Even Von Bloom himself was at first very little concerned about
them. After his feelings of apprehension, the announcement that
it was a flight of locusts was a relief, and for a while he did not
dwell upon the nature of such a phenomenon, but only regarded it
with feelings of curiosity.</p>

<p>Of a sudden his thoughts took a new direction. His eye rested
upon his fields of maize and buckwheat, upon his garden of melons,
and fruits, and vegetables: a new alarm seized upon him; the
memory of many stories which he had heard in relation to these
destructive creatures rushed into his mind, and as the whole truth
developed itself, he turned pale, and uttered new exclamations of alarm.</p>

<p>The children changed countenance as well. They saw that their
father suffered; though they knew not why. They gathered
inquiringly around him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! alas! Lost! lost!&rdquo; exclaimed he; &ldquo;yes, all our crop&mdash;our
labour of the year&mdash;gone, gone! O my dear children!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lost, father?&mdash;how gone?&rdquo; exclaimed several of them in
a breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See the springaan! they will eat up our crop&mdash;all&mdash;all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Tis true, indeed,&rdquo; said Hans, who being a great student had
often read accounts of the devastations committed by the locusts.</p>

<p>The joyous countenances of all once more wore a sad expression,
and it was no longer with curiosity that they gazed upon the distant
cloud, that so suddenly had clouded their joy.</p>

<p>Von Bloom had good cause for dread. Should the swarm come on,
and settle upon his fields, farewell to his prospects of a harvest.
They would strip the verdure from his whole farm in a twinkling.
They would leave neither seed, nor leaf, nor stalk behind them.</p>

<p>All stood watching the flight with painful emotions. The swarm
was still a full half-mile distant. They appeared to be coming no
nearer,&mdash;good!</p>

<p>A ray of hope entered the mind of the field-cornet. He took off
his broad felt hat, and held it up to the full stretch of his arm. The
wind was blowing from the north, and the swarm was directly to the
west of the kraal. The cloud of locusts had approached from the
north, as they almost invariably do in the southern parts of Africa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hendrik, who having been in their midst could tell
what way they were drifting, &ldquo;they came down upon us from a
northerly direction. When we headed our horses homewards, we
soon galloped out from them, and they did not appear to fly after
us; I am sure they were passing southwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Bloom entertained hopes that as none appeared due north
of the kraal, the swarm might pass on without extending to the
borders of his farm. He knew that they usually followed the
direction of the wind. Unless the wind changed they would not
swerve from their course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>He continued to observe them anxiously. He saw that the selvedge
of the cloud came no nearer. His hopes rose. His countenance grew
brighter. The children noticed this and were glad, but said nothing.
All stood silently watching.</p>

<p>An odd sight it was. There was not only the misty swarm of the
insects to gaze upon. The air above them was filled with birds&mdash;strange
birds and of many kinds. On slow, silent wing soared the
brown &ldquo;oricou,&rdquo; the largest of Africa's vultures; and along with
him the yellow &ldquo;chasse fiente,&rdquo; the vulture of Kolb&eacute;. There swept
the bearded &ldquo;lamvanger,&rdquo; on broad extended wings. There shrieked
the great &ldquo;Caffre eagle,&rdquo; and side by side with him the short-tailed
and singular &ldquo;bateleur.&rdquo; There, too were hawks of different sizes
and colours, and kites cutting through the air, and crows and
ravens, and many species of <i>insectivora</i>.</p>

<p>But far more numerous than all the rest could be seen the little
<i>springhaan-vogel</i>, a speckled bird of nearly the size and form of
a swallow. Myriads of these darkened the air above&mdash;hundreds of
them continually shooting down among the insects, and soaring up
again each with a victim in its beak. &ldquo;Locust-vultures&rdquo; are these
creatures named, though not vultures in kind. They feed exclusively
on these insects, and are never seen where the locusts are not. They
follow them through all their migrations, building their nests, and
rearing their young, in the midst of their prey!</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a curious sight to look upon, that swarm of winged
insects, and their numerous and varied enemies; and all stood
gazing upon it with feelings of wonder. Still the living cloud
approached no nearer, and the hopes of Von Bloom continued to
rise.</p>

<p>The swarm kept extending to the south&mdash;in fact, it now stretched
along the whole western horizon; and all noticed that it was gradually
getting lower down&mdash;that is, its top edge was sinking in the
heavens. Were the locusts passing off to the west? No.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Da am goin roost for da nacht&mdash;now we'll get 'em in bag-full,&rdquo;
said Swartboy, with a pleased look; for Swartboy was a regular
locust-eater, as fond of them as either eagle or kite,&mdash;aye, as the
&ldquo;springhaan-vogel&rdquo; itself.</p>

<p>It was as Swartboy had stated. The swarm was actually settling
down on the plain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can't fly without sun,&rdquo; continued the Bushman. &ldquo;Too cold
now. Dey go dead till da mornin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it was. The sun had set. The cool breeze weakened the
wings of the insect travellers; and they were compelled to make
halt for the night upon the trees, bushes, and grass.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the dark mist that had hid the blue rim of the
sky, was seen no more; but the distant plain looked as if a fire had
swept over it. It was thickly covered with the bodies of the insects,
that gave it a blackened appearance as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>The attendant birds, perceiving the approach of night, screamed
for awhile, and then scattered away through the heavens. Some
perched upon the rocks, while others went to roost among the low
thickets of mimosa; and now for a short interval both earth and air
were silent.</p>

<p>Von Bloom now bethought him of his cattle. Their forms were
seen afar off in the midst of the locust-covered plain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let 'em feed um little while, baas,&rdquo; suggested Swartboy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On what?&rdquo; inquired his master. &ldquo;Don't you see the grass is
covered!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On de springhaan demself, baas,&rdquo; replied the Bushman; &ldquo;good
for fatten big ox&mdash;better dan grass&mdash;ya, better dan <i>mealies</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was too late to leave the cattle longer out upon the plain.
The lions would soon be abroad&mdash;the sooner because of the locusts,
for the king of the beasts does not disdain to fill his royal stomach
with these insects&mdash;when he can find them.</p>

<p>Von Bloom saw the necessity of bringing his cattle at once to their
kraal.</p>

<p>A third horse was saddled, which the field-cornet himself mounted,
and rode off, followed by Hendrik and Swartboy.</p>

<p>On approaching the locusts they beheld a singular sight. The
ground was covered with these reddish-brown creatures, in some
spots to the depth of several inches. What bushes there were were
clustered with them,&mdash;all over the leaves and branches, as if swarms
of bees had settled upon them. Not a leaf or blade of grass that
was not covered with their bodies!</p>

<p>They moved not, but remained silent, as if torpid or asleep. The
cold of the evening had deprived them of the power of flight.</p>

<p>What was strangest of all to the eyes of Von Bloom and Hendrik,
was the conduct of their own horses and cattle. These were some
distance out in the midst of the sleeping host; but instead of being
alarmed at their odd situation, they were greedily gathering up the
insects in mouthfuls, and crunching them as though they had been
corn!</p>

<p>It was with some difficulty that they could be driven off; but the
roar of a lion, that was just then heard over the plain, and the
repeated application of Swartboy's <i>jambok</i>, rendered them more
tractable, and at length they suffered themselves to be driven home,
and lodged within their kraals.</p>

<p>Swartboy had provided himself with a bag, which he carried back
full of locusts.</p>

<p>It was observed that in collecting the insects into the bag, he acted
with some caution, handling them very gingerly, as if he was afraid
of them. It was not them he feared, but snakes which, upon such
occasions are very plenteous, and very much to be dreaded&mdash;as the
Bushman from experience well knew.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="cap">A TALK ABOUT LOCUSTS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span>t was a night of anxiety in the kraal of the field-cornet. Should the
wind veer round to the west, to a certainty the locusts would cover
his land in the morning, and the result would be the total destruction
of his crops. Perhaps worse than that. Perhaps the whole vegetation
around&mdash;for fifty miles or more&mdash;might be destroyed; and then how
would his cattle be fed? It would be no easy matter even to save
their lives. They might perish before he could drive them to any
other pasturage!</p>

<p>Such a thing was by no means uncommon or improbable. In the
history of the Cape colony many a boer had lost his flocks in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
very way. No wonder there was anxiety that night in the kraal of
the field-cornet.</p>

<p>At intervals Von Bloom went out to ascertain whether there was
any change in the wind. Up to a late hour he could perceive none.
A gentle breeze still blew from the north&mdash;from the great Kalihari
desert&mdash;whence, no doubt, the locusts had come. The moon was
bright, and her light gleamed over the host of insects that darkly
covered the plain. The roar of the lion could be heard mingling with
the shrill scream of the jackal and the maniac laugh of the hyena.
All these beasts, and many more, were enjoying a plenteous repast.</p>

<p>Perceiving no change in the wind, Von Bloom became less uneasy,
and they all conversed freely about the locusts. Swartboy took a
leading part in this conversation, as he was better acquainted with
the subject than any of them. It was far from being the first flight
of locusts Swartboy had seen, and many a bushel of them had he
eaten. It was natural to suppose, therefore, that he knew a good deal
about them.</p>

<p>He knew not whence they came. That was a point about which
Swartboy had never troubled himself. The learned Hans offered an
explanation of their origin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They come from the desert,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The eggs from which they
are produced, are deposited in the sands or dust; where they lie until
rain falls, and causes the herbage to spring up. Then the locusts are
hatched, and in their first stage are supported upon this herbage.
When it becomes exhausted, they are compelled to go in search of
food. Hence these 'migrations,' as they are called.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This explanation seemed clear enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I have heard,&rdquo; said Hendrik, &ldquo;of farmers kindling fires
around their crops to keep off the locusts. I can't see how fires would
keep them off&mdash;not even if a regular fence of fire were made all round
a field. These creatures have wings, and could easily fly over the
fires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fires,&rdquo; replied Hans, &ldquo;are kindled, in order that the smoke
may prevent them from alighting; but the locusts to which these
accounts usually refer are without wings, called <i>voetgangers</i> (foot-goers).
They are, in fact, the <i>larv&aelig;</i> of these locusts, before they have
obtained their wings. These have also their migrations, that are
often more destructive than those of the perfect insects, such as we
see here. They proceed over the ground by crawling and leaping
like grasshoppers; for, indeed, they are grasshoppers&mdash;a species of
them. They keep on in one direction, as if they were guided by
instinct to follow a particular course. Nothing can interrupt them
in their onward march unless the sea or some broad and rapid river.
Small streams they can swim across; and large ones, too, where they
run sluggishly; walls and houses they can climb&mdash;even the chimneys&mdash;going
straight over them; and the moment they have reached the
other side of any obstacle, they continue straight onward in the old
direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In attempting to cross broad rapid rivers, they are drowned in
countless myriads, and swept off to the sea. When it is only a small
migration, the farmers sometimes keep them off by means of fires, as
you have heard. On the contrary, when large numbers appear, even
the fires are of no avail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how is that, brother?&rdquo; inquired Hendrik. &ldquo;I can understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
how fires would stop the kind you speak of, since you say they
are without wings. But since they are so, how do they get through
the fires? Jump them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not so,&rdquo; replied Hans. &ldquo;The fires are built too wide and large
for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How then, brother?&rdquo; asked Hendrik. &ldquo;I'm puzzled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said little Jan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; added Tr&uuml;ey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; continued Hans, &ldquo;millions of the insects crawl into
the fires and put them out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; cried all in astonishment. &ldquo;How? Are they not burned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Hans. &ldquo;They are scorched and killed&mdash;myriads
of them quite burned up. But their bodies crowded thickly on the
fires choke them out. The foremost ranks of the great host thus
become victims, and the others pass safely across upon the holocaust
thus made. So you see, even fires cannot stop the course of the locusts
when they are in great numbers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In many parts of Africa, where the natives cultivate the soil, as
soon as they discover a migration of these insects, and perceive that
they are heading in the direction of their fields and gardens, quite a
panic is produced among them. They know that they will lose their
crops to a certainty, and hence dread a visitation of locusts as they
would an earthquake, or some other great calamity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can well understand their feelings upon such an occasion,&rdquo;
remarked Hendrik, with a significant look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The flying locusts,&rdquo; continued Hans, &ldquo;seem less to follow a
particular direction than their larv&aelig;. The former seem to be guided
by the wind. Frequently this carries them all into the sea, where
they perish in vast numbers. On some parts of the coast their dead
bodies have been found washed back to land in quantities incredible.
At one place the sea threw them upon the beach, until they lay piled
up in a ridge four feet in height, and fifty miles in length! It has
been asserted by several well-known travellers that the effluvium
from this mass tainted the air to such an extent that it was perceived
one hundred and fifty miles inland!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heigh!&rdquo; exclaimed little Jan. &ldquo;I didn't think anybody had so
good a nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At little Jan's remark there was a general laugh. Von Bloom did
not join in their merriment. He was in too serious a mood just then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; inquired little Tr&uuml;ey, perceiving that her father did not
laugh, and thinking to draw him into the conversation,&mdash;&ldquo;Papa!
were these the kind of locusts eaten by John the Baptist when in the
desert? His food, the Bible says, was 'locusts and wild honey.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe these are the same,&rdquo; replied the father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, papa,&rdquo; modestly rejoined Hans, &ldquo;they are not exactly the
same, but a kindred species. The locust of Scripture was the true
<i>Gryllus migratorius</i>, and different from those of South Africa, though
very similar in its habits.&rdquo; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;some writers dispute
that point altogether. The Abyssinians say that it was beans of the
locust-tree, and not insects, that were the food of St. John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your own opinion, Hans?&rdquo; inquired Hendrik, who had a
great belief in his brother's book-knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I think,&rdquo; replied Hans, &ldquo;there need be no question about it.
It is only torturing the meaning of a word to suppose that St. John ate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
the locust fruit, and not the insect. I am decidedly of opinion that the
latter is meant in Scripture; and what makes me think so is, that these
two kinds of food, 'locusts and wild honey,' are often coupled together,
as forming at the present time the subsistence of many tribes who are
denizens of the desert. Besides, we have good evidence that both were
used as food by desert-dwelling people in the days of Scripture. It is,
therefore, but natural to suppose that St. John, when in the desert,
was forced to partake of this food; just as many a traveller of
modern times has eaten of it when crossing the deserts that surround
us here in South Africa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read a great many books about locusts,&rdquo; continued Hans;
&ldquo;and now that the Bible has been mentioned, I must say for my part,
I know no account given of these insects so truthful and beautiful as
that in the Bible itself. Shall I read it, papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means, my boy,&rdquo; said the field-cornet, rather pleased at the
request which his son had made, and at the tenor of the conversation.</p>

<p>Little Tr&uuml;ey ran into the inner room and brought out an immense
volume bound in gemsbok skin, with a couple of brass clasps upon it
to keep it closed. This was the family Bible; and here let me observe,
that a similar book may be found in the house of nearly every boer,
for these Dutch colonists are a Protestant and Bible-loving people&mdash;so
much so, that they think nothing of going a hundred miles, four
times in the year, to attend the <i>nacht-maal</i>, or sacramental supper!
What do you think of that?</p>

<p>Hans opened the volume, and turned at once to the book of the
prophet Joel. From the readiness with which he found the passage,
it was evident he was well acquainted with the book he held in his
hands.</p>

<p>He read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick
darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains; a great people
and a strong: there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any
more after it, even to the years of many generations. A fire devoureth
before them, and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the
garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness;
yea, and nothing shall escape them. The appearance of them is as
the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run. Like
the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the
noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people
set in battle array. The earth shall quake before them; the heavens
shall tremble; the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall
withdraw their shining. How do the beasts groan! the herds of
cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of
sheep are made desolate.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Even the rude Swartboy could perceive the poetic beauty of this
description.</p>

<p>But Swartboy had much to say about the locusts, as well as the
inspired Joel.</p>

<p>Thus spoke Swartboy:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bushman no fear da springhaan. Bushman hab no garden&mdash;no
maize&mdash;no buckwheat&mdash;no nothing for da springhaan to eat. Bushman
eat locust himself&mdash;he grow fat on da locust. Ebery thing eat
dem dar springhaan. Ebery thing grow fat in da locust season. Ho!
den for dem springhaan!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span></p>

<p>These remarks of Swartboy were true enough. The locusts are
eaten by almost every species of animal known in South Africa. Not
only do the <i>carnivora</i> greedily devour them, but also animals and birds
of the game kind&mdash;such as antelopes, partridges, guinea-fowls, bustards,
and, strange to say, the giant of all&mdash;the huge elephant&mdash;will travel
for miles to overtake a migration of locusts! Domestic fowls, sheep,
horses, and dogs, devour them with equal greediness. Still another
strange fact&mdash;the locusts eat one another! If any one of them gets
hurt, so as to impede his progress, the others immediately turn upon
him and eat him up!</p>

<p>The Bushmen and other native races of Africa submit the locusts to
a process of cookery before eating them; and during the whole evening
Swartboy had been engaged in preparing the bagful which he had
collected. He &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; them thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>He first boiled, or rather steamed them, for only a small quantity of
water was put into the pot. This process lasted two hours. They
were then taken out, and allowed to dry; and after that shaken about
in a pan, until all the legs and wings were broken off from the bodies.
A winnowing process&mdash;Swartboy's thick lips acting as a fan&mdash;was next
gone through; and the legs and wings were thus got rid of. The
locusts were then ready for eating.</p>

<p>A little salt only was required to render them more palatable, when
all present made trial of, and some of the children even liked them.
By many, locusts prepared in this way are considered quite equal to
shrimps!</p>

<p>Sometimes they are pounded when quite dry into a sort of meal,
and with water added to them, are made into a kind of stirabout.</p>

<p>When well dried, they will keep for a long time; and they frequently
form the only store of food which the poorer natives have to depend
upon for a whole season.</p>

<p>Among many tribes&mdash;particularly among those who are not agricultural&mdash;the
coming of the locusts is a source of rejoicing. These
people turn out with sacks, and often with pack-oxen to collect and
bring them to the villages; and on such occasions vast heaps of them
are accumulated and stored, in the same way as grain!</p>

<p>Conversing of these things the night passed on until it was time for
going to bed. The field-cornet went out once again to observe the
wind; and then the door of the little kraal was closed, and the family
retired to rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE LOCUST-FLIGHT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he field-cornet slept but little. Anxiety kept him awake. He turned
and tossed, and thought of the locusts. He napped at intervals, and
dreamt about locusts, and crickets, and grasshoppers, and all manner
of great long-legged, goggle-eyed insects. He was glad when the first
ray of light penetrated through the little window of his chamber.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet; and, scarce staying to dress himself, rushed
out into the open air. It was still dark, but he did not require to see
the wind. He did not need to toss a feather or hold up his hat. The
truth was too plain. A strong breeze was blowing&mdash;it was blowing
<i>from the west</i>!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>

<p>Half distracted, he ran farther out to assure himself. He ran until
clear of the walls that enclosed the kraals and garden.</p>

<p>He halted and felt the air. Alas! his first impression was correct.
The breeze blew directly from the west&mdash;directly from the locusts.
He could perceive the effluvium borne from the hateful insects: there
was no longer cause to doubt.</p>

<p>Groaning in spirit, Von Bloom returned to his house. He had no
longer any hope of escaping the terrible visitation.</p>

<p>His first directions were to collect all the loose pieces of linen or
clothing in the house, and pack them within the family chests. What!
would the locusts be likely to eat them?</p>

<p>Indeed, yes&mdash;for these voracious creatures are not fastidious. No
particular vegetable seems to be chosen by them. The leaves of the
bitter tobacco plant appear to be as much to their liking as the
sweet and succulent blades of maize! Pieces of linen, cotton, and
even flannel, are devoured by them, as though they were the tender
shoots of plants. Stones, iron, and hard wood, are about the only
objects that escape their fierce masticators.</p>

<p>Von Bloom had heard this, Hans had read of it, and Swartboy confirmed
it from his own experience.</p>

<p>Consequently, everything that was at all destructible was carefully
stowed away; and then breakfast was cooked and eaten in
silence.</p>

<p>There was a gloom over the faces of all, because he who was the head
of all was silent and dejected. What a change within a few hours!
But the evening before the field-cornet and his little family were in the
full enjoyment of happiness.</p>

<p>There was still one hope, though a slight one. Might it yet rain?
Or might the day turn out cold?</p>

<p>In either case Swartboy said the locusts could not take wing&mdash;for
they cannot fly in cold or rainy weather. In the event of a cold or
wet day they would have to remain as they were, and perhaps the
wind might change round again before they resumed their flight. Oh,
for a torrent of rain, or a cold cloudy day!</p>

<p>Vain wish! vain hope! In half-an-hour after the sun rose up in
African splendour, and his hot rays, slanting down upon the sleeping
host, warmed them into life and activity. They commenced to
crawl, to hop about, and then, as if by one impulse, myriads rose
into the air. The breeze impelled them in the direction in which it
was blowing,&mdash;in the direction of the devoted maize fields.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes, from the time they had taken wing, they
were over the kraal, and dropping in tens of thousands upon the
surrounding fields. Slow was their flight, and gentle their descent,
and to the eyes of those beneath they presented the appearance of a
shower of <i>black</i> snow, falling in large feathery flakes. In a few
moments the ground was completely covered, until every stalk of
maize, every plant and bush, carried its hundreds. On the outer
plains too, as far as eye could see, the pasture was strewed thickly;
and as the great flight had now passed to the eastward of the house,
the sun's disk was again hidden by them as if by an eclipse!</p>

<p>They seemed to move in a kind of <i>echelon</i>, the bands in the rear
constantly flying to the front, and then halting to feed, until in turn
these were headed by others that had advanced over them in a
similar manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<p>The noise produced by their wings was not the least curious phenomenon;
and resembled a steady breeze playing among the leaves
of the forest, or the sound of a water-wheel.</p>

<p>For two hours this passage continued. During most of that time,
Von Bloom and his people had remained within the house, with
closed doors and windows. This they did to avoid the unpleasant
shower, as the creatures impelled by the breeze, often strike the
cheek so forcibly as to cause a feeling of pain. Moreover, they did
not like treading upon the unwelcome intruders, and crushing them
under their feet, which they must have done, had they moved about
outside where the ground was thickly covered.</p>

<p>Many of the insects even crawled inside, through the chinks of the
door and windows, and greedily devoured any vegetable substance
which happened to be lying about the floor.</p>

<p>At the end of two hours Von Bloom looked forth. The thickest of
the flight had passed. The sun was again shining; but upon what
was he shining? No longer upon green fields and a flowery garden.
No. Around the house, on every side, north, south, east, and west,
the eye rested only on black desolation. Not a blade of grass, not a
leaf could be seen&mdash;even the very bark was stripped from the trees,
that now stood as if withered by the hand of God! Had fire swept
the surface, it could not have left it more naked and desolate. There
was no garden, there were no fields of maize or buckwheat, there was
no longer a farm&mdash;the kraal stood in the midst of a desert!</p>

<p>Words cannot depict the emotions of the field-cornet at that
moment. The pen cannot describe his painful feelings.</p>

<p>Such a change in two hours! He could scarce credit his senses&mdash;he
could scarce believe in its reality. He knew that the locusts
would eat up his maize, and his wheat, and the vegetables of his
garden; but his fancy had fallen far short of the extreme desolation
that had actually been produced. The whole landscape was metamorphosed&mdash;grass
was out of the question&mdash;trees, whose delicate
foliage had played in the soft breeze but two short hours before, now
stood leafless, scathed by worse than winter. The very ground
seemed altered in shape! He would not have known it as his own
farm. Most certainly had the owner been absent during the period
of the locust-flight, and approached without any information of what
had been passing, he would not have recognised the place of his own
habitation!</p>

<p>With the phlegm peculiar to his race, the field-cornet sat down,
and remained for a long time without speech or movement.</p>

<p>His children gathered near, and looked on&mdash;their young hearts
painfully throbbing. They could not fully appreciate the difficult
circumstances in which this occurrence had placed them; nor did
their father himself at first. He thought only of the loss he had
sustained, in the destruction of his fine crops; and this of itself,
when we consider his isolated situation, and the hopelessness of
restoring them, was enough to cause him very great chagrin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone! all gone!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a sorrowing voice. &ldquo;Oh!
Fortune&mdash;Fortune&mdash;again art thou cruel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa! do not grieve,&rdquo; said a soft voice; &ldquo;we are all alive yet, we
are here by your side;&rdquo; and with the words a little white hand was
laid upon his shoulder. It was the hand of the beautiful Tr&uuml;ey.</p>

<p>It seemed as if an angel had smiled upon him. He lifted the child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
in his arms, and in a paroxysm of fondness pressed her to his heart.
That heart felt relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring me the Book,&rdquo; said he, addressing one of the boys.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/illus-332.jpg" width="356" height="500" alt="THE SHOWER OF LOCUSTS." title="THE SHOWER OF LOCUSTS." />
<span class="caption">THE SHOWER OF LOCUSTS.</span></div>

<p>The Bible was brought&mdash;its massive covers were opened&mdash;a verse
was chosen&mdash;and the song of praise rose up in the midst of the
desert.</p>

<p>The Book was closed; and for some minutes all knelt in prayer.</p>

<p>When Von Bloom again stood upon his feet, and looked around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
him, the desert seemed once more to &ldquo;rejoice and blossom as the
rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon the human heart such is the magic influence of resignation
and humility.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="cap">&ldquo;INSPANN AND TREK!&rdquo;</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">W</span>ith all his confidence in the protection of a Supreme Being, Von
Bloom knew that he was not to leave everything to the Divine hand.
That was not the religion he had been taught; and he at once set
about taking measures to extricate himself from the unpleasant
position in which he was placed.</p>

<p>Unpleasant position! Ha! It was more than unpleasant, as the
field-cornet began to perceive. It was a position of peril!</p>

<p>The more Von Bloom reflected, the more was he convinced of this.
There they were, in the middle of a black naked plain, that without
a green spot extended beyond the limits of vision. How much
farther he could not guess; but he knew that the devastations of the
migratory locust sometimes cover an area of thousands of miles! It
was certain that the one that had just swept past was on a very
extensive scale.</p>

<p>It was evident he could no longer remain by his kraal. His
horses, and cattle, and sheep, could not live without food; and should
these perish, upon what were he and his family to subsist? He must
leave the kraal. He must go in search of pasture, without loss of
time,&mdash;at once. Already the animals, shut up beyond their usual
hour, were uttering their varied cries, impatient to be let out. They
would soon hunger; and it was hard to say when food could be
procured for them.</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost. Every hour was of great importance,&mdash;even
minutes must not be wasted in dubious hesitation.</p>

<p>The field-cornet spent but a few minutes in consideration.
Whether should he mount one of his best horses, and ride off alone
in search of pasture? or whether would it not be better to &ldquo;inspann&rdquo;
his wagon, and take everything along with him at once?</p>

<p>He soon decided in favour of the latter course. In any case he
would have been compelled to move from his present location,&mdash;to
leave the kraal altogether.</p>

<p>He might as well take everything at once. Should he go out
alone, it might cost him a long time to find grass and water&mdash;for both
would be necessary&mdash;and, meantime, his stock would be suffering.</p>

<p>These and other considerations decided him at once to &ldquo;inspann&rdquo;
and &ldquo;trek&rdquo; away, with his wagon, his horses, his cattle, his sheep,
his &ldquo;household goods,&rdquo; and his whole family circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inspann and trek!&rdquo; was the command: and Swartboy, who was
proud of the reputation he had earned as a wagon-driver, was now
seen waving his bamboo whip like a great fishing-rod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inspann and trek!&rdquo; echoed Swartboy, tying upon his twenty-feet
lash a new cracker, which he had twisted out of the skin of the
hartebeest antelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inspann and trek!&rdquo; he repeated, making his vast whip crack like
a pistol; &ldquo;yes, baas, I'll inspann;&rdquo; and, having satisfied himself that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
his &ldquo;voor-slag&rdquo; was properly adjusted, Swartboy rested the bamboo
handle against the side of the house, and proceeded to the kraal to
collect the yoke-oxen.</p>

<p>A large wagon, of a sort that is the pride and property of every
Cape farmer, stood to one side of the house. It was a vehicle of the
first class,&mdash;a regular &ldquo;cap-tent&rdquo; wagon,&mdash;that had been made for
the field-cornet in his better days, and in which he had been used to
drive his wife and children to the &ldquo;nacht-maal,&rdquo; and upon <i>vrolykheids</i>
(parties of pleasure). In those days a team of eight fine horses used
to draw it along at a rattling rate. Alas! oxen had now to take
their place; for Von Bloom had but five horses in his whole stud,
and these were required for the saddle.</p>

<p>But the wagon was almost as good as ever it had been,&mdash;almost as
good as when it used to be the envy of the field-cornet's neighbours,
the boers of Graaf Reinet. Nothing was broken. Everything was
in its place,&mdash;&ldquo;voor-kist,&rdquo; and &ldquo;achter-kist,&rdquo; and side-chests. There
was the snow-white cap, with its &ldquo;fore-clap&rdquo; and &ldquo;after-clap,&rdquo; and
its inside pockets, all complete; and the wheels neatly carved, and
the well-planed boxing and &ldquo;disselboom,&rdquo; and the strong &ldquo;trektow&rdquo;
of buffalo-hide. Nothing was wanting that ought to be found about
a wagon. It was, in fact, the best part of the field-cornet's property
that remained to him,&mdash;for it was equal in value to all the oxen,
cattle, and sheep, upon his establishment.</p>

<p>While Swartboy, assisted by Hendrik, was catching up the twelve
yoke-oxen, and attaching them to the disselboom and trektow of the
wagon, the &ldquo;baas&rdquo; himself, aided by Hans, Totty, and also by Tr&uuml;ey
and little Jan, was loading up the furniture and implements. This
was not a difficult task. The <i>Penates</i> of the little kraal were not
numerous, and were all soon packed either inside or around the
roomy vehicle.</p>

<p>In about an hour's time the wagon was loaded up, the oxen were
inspanned, the horses saddled, and everything was ready for &ldquo;trekking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now arose the question, <i>whither</i>?</p>

<p>Up to this time Von Bloom had only thought of getting away
from the spot&mdash;of escaping beyond the naked waste that surrounded
him.</p>

<p>It now became necessary to determine the direction in which they
were to travel&mdash;a most important consideration.</p>

<p>Important, indeed, as a little reflection showed. They might go in
the direction in which the locusts had gone, or that in which they
had come? On either route they might travel for scores of miles
without meeting with a mouthful of grass for the hungry animals;
and in such a case these would break down and perish.</p>

<p>Or the travellers might move in some other direction, and find
grass, but not water. Without water, not only would they have to
fear for the cattle, but for themselves&mdash;for their own lives. How
important then it was, which way they turned their faces!</p>

<p>At first the field-cornet bethought him of heading towards the
settlements. The nearest water in that direction was almost fifty
miles off. It lay to the eastward of the kraal. The locusts had just
gone that way. They would by this time have laid waste the whole
country&mdash;perhaps to the water or beyond it!</p>

<p>It would be a great risk going in that direction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<p>Northward lay the Kalihari desert. It would be hopeless to steer
north. Von Bloom knew of no o&auml;sis in the desert. Besides the
locusts had come from the north. They were drifting southward
when first seen; and from the time they had been observed passing
in this last direction, they had no doubt ere this wasted the plains
far to the south.</p>

<p>The thoughts of the field-cornet were now turned to the west. It
is true the swarm had last approached from the west; but Von
Bloom fancied that they had first come down from the north, and
that the sudden veering round of the wind had caused them to
change direction. He thought that by trekking westward he would
soon get beyond the ground they had laid bare.</p>

<p>He knew something of the plains to the west&mdash;not much indeed,
but he knew that at about forty miles distance there was a spring
with good pasturage around it, upon whose water he could depend.
He had once visited it, while on a search for some of his cattle, that
had wandered thus far. Indeed, it then appeared to him a better
situation for cattle than the one he held, and he had often thought
of moving to it. Its great distance from any civilized settlement was
the reason why he had not done so. Although he was already far
beyond the frontier, he still kept up a sort of communication with
the settlements, whereas at the more distant point such a communication
would be extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Now that other considerations weighed with him, his thoughts
once more returned to this spring; and after spending a few minutes
more in earnest deliberation, he decided upon &ldquo;trekking&rdquo; westward.</p>

<p>Swartboy was ordered to head round, and strike to the west. The
Bushman promptly leaped to his seat upon the voor-kist, cracked
his mighty whip, straightened out his long team, and moved off over
the plain.</p>

<p>Hans and Hendrik were already in their saddles; and having
cleared the kraals of all their live stock, with the assistance of the
dogs, drove the lowing and bleating animals before them.</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey and little Jan sat beside Swartboy on the fore-chest of the
wagon; and the round full eyes of the pretty springbok could be
seen peeping curiously out from under the cap-tent.</p>

<p>Casting a last look upon his desolate kraal, the field-cornet turned
his horse's head, and rode after the wagon.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class="cap">WATER! WATER!</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>n moved the little caravan, but not in silence. Swartboy's voice
and whip made an almost continual noise. The latter could be
plainly heard more than a mile over the plain, like repeated discharges
of a musket. Hendrik, too, did a good deal in the way of
shouting; and even the usually quiet Hans was under the necessity
of using his voice to urge the flock forward in the right direction.</p>

<p>Occasionally both the boys were called upon to give Swartboy a
help with the leading oxen when those became obstinate or restive,
and would turn out of the track. At such times either Hans or
Hendrik would gallop up, set the heads of the animals right again,
and ply the &ldquo;jamboks&rdquo; upon their sides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p>This &ldquo;jambok&rdquo; is a severe chastener to an obstinate ox. It is an
elastic whip made of rhinoceros or hippopotamus skin,&mdash;hippopotamus
is the best,&mdash;near six feet long, and tapering regularly from
butt to tip.</p>

<p>Whenever the led oxen misbehaved, and Swartboy could not reach
them with his long &ldquo;voor-slag,&rdquo; Hendrik was ever ready to tickle
them with his tough jambok; and, by this means, frighten them into
good behaviour. Indeed, one of the boys was obliged to be at their
head nearly all the time.</p>

<p>A leader is used to accompany most teams of oxen in South Africa.
But those of the field-cornet had been accustomed to draw the
wagon without one, ever since the Hottentot servants ran away;
and Swartboy had driven many miles with no other help than his
long whip. But the strange look of everything, since the locusts
passed, had made the oxen shy and wild; besides the insects had
obliterated every track or path which oxen would have followed.
The whole surface was alike,&mdash;there was neither trace nor mark.
Even Von Bloom himself could with difficulty recognise the features
of the country, and had to guide himself by the sun in the sky.</p>

<p>Hendrik stayed mostly by the head of the leading oxen. Hans
had no difficulty in driving the flock when once fairly started. A
sense of fear kept all together, and as there was no herbage upon any
side to tempt them to stray, they moved regularly on.</p>

<p>Von Bloom rode in front to guide the caravan. Neither he nor
any of them had made any change in their costume, but travelled in
their everyday dress. The field-cornet himself was habited after the
manner of most boers, in wide leathern trousers, termed in that
country &ldquo;crackers;&rdquo; a large roomy jacket of green cloth, with ample
outside pockets; a fawn-skin waistcoat; a huge white felt hat, with
the broadest of brims; and upon his feet a pair of brogans of African
unstained leather, known among the boers as &ldquo;feldt-schoenen&rdquo;
(country shoes). Over his saddle lay a &ldquo;kaross,&rdquo; or robe of leopard-skins,
and upon his shoulder he carried his &ldquo;roer&rdquo;&mdash;a large smooth-bore
gun, about six feet in length, with an old-fashioned flint-lock,&mdash;quite
a load of itself.</p>

<p>This is the gun in which the boer puts all his trust; and although
an American backwoodsman would at first sight be disposed to
laugh at such a weapon, a little knowledge of the boer's country
would change his opinion of the &ldquo;roer.&rdquo; His own weapon&mdash;the
small-bore rifle, with a bullet less than a pea&mdash;would be almost useless
among the large game that inhabits the country of the boer.
Upon the &ldquo;karoos&rdquo; of Africa there are crack shots and sterling
hunters, as well as in the backwoods or on the prairies of America.</p>

<p>Curving round under the field-cornet's left arm, and resting against
his side, was an immense powder-horn&mdash;of such size as could only be
produced upon the head of an African ox. It was from the country
of the Bechuanas, though nearly all Cape oxen grow horns of vast
dimensions. Of course it was used to carry the field-cornet's powder,
and, if full, it must have contained half-a-dozen pounds at least!
A leopard-skin pouch hanging under his right arm, a hunting-knife
stuck in his waist-belt, and a large meerschaum pipe through the
band of his hat, completed the equipments of the trek-boer, Von
Bloom.</p>

<p>Hans and Hendrik were very similarly attired, armed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
equipped. Of course their trousers were of dressed sheep-skin, wide&mdash;like
the trousers of all young boers&mdash;and they also wore jackets
and &ldquo;feldt-schoenen,&rdquo; and broad-brimmed white hats. Hans carried
a light fowling-piece, while Hendrik's gun was a stout rifle of the
kind known as a &ldquo;y&auml;ger&rdquo; an excellent gun for large game. In this
piece Hendrik had great pride, and had learnt to drive a nail with it
at nearly a hundred paces. Hendrik was <i>par excellence</i> the marksman
of the party. Each of the boys also carried a large crescent-shaped
powder-horn, with a pouch for bullets; and over the saddle
of each was strapped the robe or kaross, differing only from their
father's in that his was of the rarer leopard-skin, while theirs were
a commoner sort, one of antelope, and the other of jackal-skin.</p>

<p>Little Jan also wore wide trousers, jacket, &ldquo;feldt-schoenen,&rdquo; and
broad-brimmed beaver,&mdash;in fact, Jan, although scarce a yard high,
was, in point of costume, a type of his father,&mdash;a diminutive type of
the boer. Tr&uuml;ey was habited in a skirt of blue woollen stuff, with
a neat bodice elaborately stitched and embroidered after the Dutch
fashion, and over her fair locks she wore a light sun-hat of straw
with a ribbon and strings. Totty was very plainly attired in strong
homespun, without any head-dress. As for Swartboy, a pair of old
leathern &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; and a striped shirt were all the clothing he
carried, beside his sheep-skin kaross. Such were the costumes of
our travellers.</p>

<p>For full twenty miles the plain was wasted bare. Not a bite could
the beasts obtain, and water there was none. The sun during the
day shone brightly,&mdash;too brightly, for his beams were as hot as
within the tropics. The travellers could scarce have borne them had
it not been that a stiff breeze was blowing all day long. But this
unfortunately blew directly in their faces, and the dry karoos are
never without dust. The constant hopping of the locusts with their
millions of tiny feet had loosened the crust of earth: and now the
dust rose freely upon the wind. Clouds of it enveloped the little
caravan, and rendered their forward movement both difficult and
disagreeable. Long before night their clothes were covered, their
mouths filled, and their eyes sore.</p>

<p>But all that was nothing. Long before night a far greater
grievance was felt,&mdash;the want of water!</p>

<p>In their hurry to escape from the desolate scene at the kraal, Von
Bloom had not thought of bringing a supply in the wagon&mdash;a sad
oversight, in a country like South Africa, where springs are so rare,
and running streams so uncertain. A sad oversight indeed, as they
now learnt&mdash;for long before night they were all crying out for water&mdash;all
were equally suffering from the pangs of thirst.</p>

<p>Von Bloom thirsted, but he did not think of himself, except that
he suffered from self-accusation. He blamed himself for neglecting
to bring a needful supply of water. He was the cause of the
sufferings of all the rest. He felt sad and humbled on account of
his thoughtless negligence.</p>

<p>He could promise them no relief&mdash;at least none until they should
reach the spring. He knew of no water nearer.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to reach the spring that night. It was late
when they started. Oxen travel slowly. Half the distance would
be as much as they could make by sundown.</p>

<p>To reach the water they would have to travel all night; but they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
could not do that for many reasons. The oxen would require to rest&mdash;the
more so that they were hungered; and now Von Bloom
thought, when too late, of another neglect he had committed&mdash;that
was, in not collecting, during the flight of the locusts, a sufficient
quantity of them to have given his cattle a feed.</p>

<p>This plan is often adopted under similar circumstances; but the
field-cornet had not thought of it: and as but few locusts fell in the
trails where the animals had been confined, they had therefore been
without food since the previous day. The oxen in particular showed
symptoms of weakness, and drew the wagon sluggishly; so that
Swartboy's voice and long whip were kept in constant action.</p>

<p>But there were other reasons why they would have to halt when
night came on. The field-cornet was not so sure of the direction.
He would not be able to follow it by night, as there was not the
semblance of a track to guide him. Besides it would be dangerous
to travel by night, for then the nocturnal robber of Africa&mdash;the
fierce lion&mdash;is abroad.</p>

<p>They would be under the necessity, therefore, of halting for the
night, water or no water.</p>

<p>It wanted yet half-an-hour of sundown when Von Bloom had
arrived at this decision. He only kept on a little farther in hopes of
reaching a spot where there was grass. They were now more than
twenty miles from their starting-point, and still the black &ldquo;spoor&rdquo;
of the locusts covered the plain. Still no grass to be seen, still the
bushes bare of their leaves, and barked!</p>

<p>The field-cornet began to think that he was trekking right in
the way the locusts had come. Westward he was heading for
certain; he knew that. But he was not yet certain that the flight had
not advanced from the west instead of the north. If so, they might
go for days before coming upon a patch of grass!</p>

<p>These thoughts troubled him, and with anxious eyes he swept the
plain in front, as well as to the right and left.</p>

<p>A shout from the keen-eyed Bushman produced a joyful effect.
He saw grass in front. He saw some bushes with leaves! They
were still a mile off, but the oxen, as if the announcement had been
understood by them, moved more briskly forward.</p>

<p>Another mile passed over, and they came upon grass, sure enough.
It was a very scanty pasture, though&mdash;a few scattered blades
growing over the reddish surface, but in no place a mouthful for
an ox. There was just enough to tantalize the poor brutes without
filling their stomachs. It assured Von Bloom, however, that they
had now got beyond the track of the locusts; and he kept on a little
farther in hopes that the pasture might get better.</p>

<p>It did not, however. The country through which they advanced
was a wild, sterile plain&mdash;almost as destitute of vegetation as that
over which they had hitherto been travelling. It no longer owed its
nakedness to the locusts, but to the absence of water.</p>

<p>They had no more time to search for pasture. The sun was
already below the horizon when they halted to &ldquo;outspan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A &ldquo;kraal&rdquo; should have been built for the cattle, and another for
the sheep and goats. There were bushes enough to have constructed
them, but who of that tired party had the heart to cut them down
and drag them to the spot?</p>

<p>It was labour enough&mdash;the slaughtering a sheep for supper, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
collecting sufficient wood to cook it. No kraal was made. The
horses were tied around the wagon. The oxen, cattle, and sheep
and goats, were left free to go where they pleased. As there was no
pasture near to tempt them, it was hoped that, after the fatigue of
their long journey, they would not stray far from the camp-fire,
which was kept burning throughout the night.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE FATE OF THE HERD.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">B</span>ut they did stray.</p>

<p>When day broke, and the travellers looked around them, not a head
of the oxen or cattle was to be seen. Yes, there was one, and one only&mdash;the
milch-cow. Totty, after milking her on the previous night, had
left her tied to a bush where she still remained. All the rest were
gone, and the sheep and goats as well.</p>

<p>Whither had they strayed?</p>

<p>The horses were mounted, and search was made. The sheep and
goats were found among some bushes not far off; but it soon appeared
that the other animals had gone clean away.</p>

<p>Their spoor was traced for a mile or two. It led back on the very
track they had come; and no doubt any longer existed that they had
returned to the kraal.</p>

<p>To overtake them before reaching that point, would be difficult, if
at all possible. Their tracks showed that they had gone off early in
the night, and had travelled at a rapid rate&mdash;so that by this time
they had most likely arrived at their old home.</p>

<p>This was a sad discovery. To have followed them on the thirsting
and hungry horses would have been a useless work; yet without
the yoke-oxen how was the wagon to be taken forward to the
spring?</p>

<p>It appeared to be a sad dilemma they were in; but after a short
consultation the thoughtful Hans suggested a solution of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we not attach the horses to the wagon?&rdquo; inquired he. &ldquo;The
five could surely draw it on to the spring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! and leave the cattle behind?&rdquo; said Hendrik. &ldquo;If we do not
go after them, they will be all lost, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could go for them afterwards,&rdquo; replied Hans; &ldquo;but it is not
better first to push forward to the spring; and, after resting the
horses a while, return then for the oxen? They will have reached
the kraal by this time. There they will be sure of water anyhow,
and that will keep them alive till we get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The course suggested by Hans seemed feasible enough. At all
events, it was the best plan they could pursue; so they at once set
about putting it in execution. The horses were attached to the wagon
in the best way they could think of. Fortunately some old horse-harness
formed part of the contents of the vehicle, and these were
brought out and fitted on, as well as could be done.</p>

<p>Two horses were made fast to the disselboom as &ldquo;wheelers;&rdquo; two
others to the trektow cut to the proper length; and the fifth horse
was placed in front as a leader.</p>

<p>When all was ready, Swartboy again mounted the voor-kist,
gathered up his reins, cracked his whip, and set his team in motion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
To the delight of every one, the huge heavy-laden wagon moved off
as freely as if a full team had been inspanned.</p>

<p>Von Bloom, Hendrik, and Hans, cheered as it passed them; and
setting the milch-cow and the flock of sheep and goats in motion,
moved briskly after. Little Jan and Tr&uuml;ey still rode in the wagon;
but the others now travelled afoot, partly because they had the flock
to drive, and partly that they might not increase the load upon the
horses.</p>

<p>They all suffered greatly from thirst, but they would have suffered
still more had it not been for that valuable creature that trotted
along behind the wagon&mdash;the cow&mdash;&ldquo;old Graaf,&rdquo; as she was called.
She had yielded several pints of milk, both the night before and that
morning; and this well-timed supply had given considerable relief to
the travellers.</p>

<p>The horses behaved beautifully. Notwithstanding that their harness
was both incomplete and ill-fitted, they pulled the wagon along
after them as if not a strap or buckle had been wanting. They
appeared to know that their kind master was in a dilemma, and were
determined to draw him out of it. Perhaps, too, they smelt the
spring-water before them. At all events, before they had been many
hours in harness, they were drawing the wagon through a pretty
little valley covered with green, meadow-looking sward; and in five
minutes more were standing halted near a cool crystal spring.</p>

<p>In a short time all had drunk heartily, and were refreshed. The
horses were turned out upon the grass, and the other animals browsed
over the meadow. A good fire was made near the spring, and a
quarter of mutton cooked&mdash;upon which the travellers dined&mdash;and
then all sat waiting for the horses to fill themselves.</p>

<p>The field-cornet, seated upon one of the wagon-chests, smoked his
great pipe. He could have been contented, but for one thing&mdash;the
absence of his cattle.</p>

<p>He had arrived at a beautiful pasture-ground&mdash;a sort of o&auml;sis in the
wild plains, where there were wood, water, and grass,&mdash;everything
that the heart of a &ldquo;vee-boer&rdquo; could desire. It did not appear to be
a large tract, but enough to have sustained many hundred head of
cattle&mdash;enough for a very fine &ldquo;stock farm.&rdquo; It would have answered
his purpose admirably; and had he succeeded in bringing on his
oxen and cattle, he would at that moment have felt happy enough.
But without them what availed the fine pasturage? What could he
do there without them to stock it? They were his wealth&mdash;at least,
he had hoped in time that their increase would become wealth. They
were all of excellent breeds; and, with the exception of his twelve
yoke-oxen, and one or two long-horned Bechuana bulls, all the others
were fine young cows calculated soon to produce a large herd.</p>

<p>Of course his anxiety about these animals rendered it impossible
for him to enjoy a moment's peace of mind, until he should start back
in search of them. He had only taken out his pipe to pass the time,
while the horses were gathering a bite of grass. As soon as their
strength should be recruited a little, it was his design to take three
of the strongest of them, and with Hendrik and Swartboy, ride back
to the old kraal.</p>

<p>As soon, therefore, as the horses were ready for the road again, they
were caught and saddled up; and Von Bloom, Hendrik, and Swartboy,
mounted and set out, while Hans remained in charge of the camp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span></p>

<p>They rode at a brisk rate, determined to travel all night, and, if
possible, reach the kraal before morning. At the last point on the
route where there was grass, they off-saddled, and allowed their
horses to rest and refresh themselves. They had brought with them
some slices of the roast mutton, and this time they had not forgotten
to fill their gourd-canteens with water&mdash;so that they should not again
suffer from thirst. After an hour's halt they continued their journey.</p>

<p>It was quite night when they arrived at the spot where the oxen
had deserted them; but a clear moon was in the sky, and they were
able to follow back the wheel-tracks of the wagon, that were quite
conspicuous under the moonlight. Now and then to be satisfied, Von
Bloom requested Swartboy to examine the spoor, and see whether the
cattle had still kept the back-track. To answer this gave no great
trouble to the Bushman. He would drop from his horse, and bending
over the ground, would reply in an instant. In every case the answer
was in the affirmative. The animals had certainly gone back to their
old home.</p>

<p>Von Bloom believed they would be sure to find them there, but
should they find them <i>alive</i>? That was the question that rendered
him anxious.</p>

<p>The creatures could obtain water by the spring, but food&mdash;where?
Not a bite would they find anywhere, and would not hunger have
destroyed them all before this?</p>

<p>Day was breaking when they came in sight of the old homestead.
It presented a very odd appearance. Not one of the three would
have recognised it. After the invasion of the locusts it showed a very
altered look, but now there was something else that added to the
singularity of its appearance. A row of strange objects seemed to be
placed upon the roof ridge, and along the walls of the kraals. What
were these strange objects, for they certainly did not belong to the
buildings? This question was put by Von Bloom, partly to himself,
but loud enough for the others to hear him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Da vogels</i>!&rdquo; (the vultures), replied Swartboy.</p>

<p>Sure enough, it was a string of vultures that appeared along the
walls.</p>

<p>The sight of these filthy birds was more than ominous. It filled
Von Bloom with apprehension. What could they be doing there?
There must be carrion near?</p>

<p>The party rode forward. The day was now up, and the vultures
had grown busy. They flapped their shadowy wings, rose from the
walls, and alighted at different points around the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely there must be carrion,&rdquo; muttered Von Bloom.</p>

<p>There was carrion, and plenty of it. As the horsemen drew near
the vultures rose into the air, and a score of half-devoured carcasses
could be seen upon the ground. The long curving horns that appeared
beside each carcass, rendered it easy to tell to what sort of animals
they belonged. In the torn and mutilated fragments, Von Bloom
recognised the remains of his lost herd!</p>

<p>Not one was left alive. There could be seen the remains of all of
them, both cows and oxen, lying near the enclosures and on the
adjacent plain&mdash;each where it had fallen.</p>

<p>But how had they fallen? That was the mystery.</p>

<p>Surely they could not have perished of hunger, and so suddenly?
They could not have died of thirst, for there was the spring bubbling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
up just beside where they lay? The vultures had not killed them!
What then?</p>

<p>Von Bloom did not ask many questions. He was not left long in
doubt. As he and his companions rode over the ground, the mystery
was explained. The tracks of lions, hyenas, and jackals, made everything
clear enough. A large troop of these animals had been upon
the ground. The scarcity of game, caused by the migration of the
locusts, had no doubt rendered them more than usually ravenous, and
in consequence the cattle became their prey.</p>

<p>Where were they now? The morning light, and the sight of the
house perhaps, had driven them off. But their spoor was quite fresh.
They were near at hand, and would be certain to return again upon
the following night.</p>

<p>Von Bloom felt a strong desire to be revenged upon the hideous
brutes; and, under other circumstances, would have remained to get
a shot at them. But just then that would have been both imprudent
and unprofitable work. It would be as much as their horses could
accomplish, to get back to camp that night; so, without even entering
the old house, they watered their animals, refilled their calabashes
at the spring, and with heavy hearts once more rode away from the
kraal.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class="cap">A LION COUCHANT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>hey had not proceeded an hundred steps when an object appeared
before them that caused all three to draw bridle suddenly and simultaneously.
That object was a lion!</p>

<p>He was couched upon the plain directly in the path they intended
to take&mdash;the very same path by which they had come!</p>

<p>How was it they had not seen him before? He was under the lee
of a low bush; but, thanks to the locusts, this bush was leafless, and
its thin naked twigs formed no concealment for so large a creature as
a lion. His tawny hide shone conspicuously through them.</p>

<p>The truth is, he had not been there when the horsemen passed
towards the kraal. He had just fled from among the carcasses, on
seeing them approach; and had skulked around the walls, and then
run to their rear. He had executed this man&#339;uvre to avoid an encounter&mdash;for
a lion reasons as a man does, though not to the same
extent. Seeing the horsemen come that way, his reasoning powers
were strong enough to tell him that they were not likely to return by
the same path. It was more natural they should continue on. A man,
ignorant of all the preceding events connected with their journey,
would have reasoned much in the same way. If you have been at all
observant, you have seen other animals&mdash;such as dogs, deer, hares, or
even birds&mdash;act just as the lion did on this occasion.</p>

<p>Beyond a doubt the intellectual process described passed through
the mind of this lion; and he had skulked round to shun an encounter
with the three travellers.</p>

<p>Now a lion will not always act so&mdash;though he will in five cases out
of six, or oftener. Hence very erroneous views are held in relation to the
courage of this animal. Some naturalists, led away by what appears
to be a feeling of envy or anger, accuse the lion of downright <i>cowardice</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
denying him a single noble quality of all those that have from earliest
times been ascribed to him! Others, on the contrary, assert that he
knows no fear, either of man or beast; and these endow him with
many virtues besides courage. Both parties back up their views, not
by mere assertions, but by an ample narration of well-attested facts!</p>

<p>How is this? There is a dilemma here. Both cannot be right in
their opinions? And yet, odd as it may appear to say so, both <i>are</i>
right in a certain sense.</p>

<p>The fact is, some lions are cowardly while others are brave.</p>

<p>The truth of this might be shown by whole pages of facts, but in
this little volume we have no room. I think, however, boy reader, I
can satisfy you with an analogy.</p>

<p>Answer me&mdash;Do you know any species of animal, the individuals of
which are exactly alike in character? Think over the dogs of your
acquaintance! Are they alike, or anything near it? Are not some of
them noble, generous, faithful, brave to the death? Are not others
mean, sneaking, cowardly curs? So is it with lions. Now, you are
satisfied that my statement about the lions may be true.</p>

<p>There are many causes to affect the courage and ferocity of the lion.
His age&mdash;the state of his stomach&mdash;the season of the year&mdash;the hour
of the day&mdash;but, above all, the sort of hunters that belong to the district
he inhabits.</p>

<p>This last fact appears quite natural to those who believe in the intellect
of animals, which of course <i>I</i> do. It is perfectly natural that
the lion, as well as other animals, should soon learn the character of
his enemy, and fear him or not, as the case may be. Is this not an
old story with us? If I remember aright, we had a talk upon this
subject when speaking of the crocodiles of America. We remarked
that the alligator of the Mississippi rarely attacks man in modern
times; but it has not been always so. The rifle of the alligator-leather
hunter has tamed its ferocity. The very <i>same species</i> in South America
eats Indians by scores every year; and the crocodile of Africa is
dreaded in some parts even more than the lion!</p>

<p>It is asserted that the lions of the Cape are more cowardly in some
districts than in others. They are less brave in those districts where
they have been &ldquo;jaged&rdquo; by the courageous and stalwart boer with his
long loud-cracking &ldquo;roer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beyond the frontier, where they have no enemy but the tiny arrow
of the Bushman (who does not desire to kill them!) and the slender
&ldquo;assegai&rdquo; of the Bechuana, the lion has little or no fear of man.</p>

<p>Whether the one, before the eyes of our party, was naturally a brave
one, could not yet be told. He was one with a huge black mane, or
&ldquo;schwart-fore life,&rdquo; as the boers term it; and these are esteemed the
fiercest and most dangerous. The &ldquo;yellow-maned,&rdquo;&mdash;for there is considerable
variety in the colour of the Cape lions&mdash;is regarded as
possessing less courage; but there is some doubt about the truth of
this. The young &ldquo;black-manes&rdquo; may often be mistaken for the true
yellow variety, and their character ascribed to him to his prejudice,&mdash;for
the swarthy colour of the mane only comes after the lion is many
years of age.</p>

<p>Whether the &ldquo;schwart-fore life&rdquo; was a fierce and brave one, Von
Bloom did not stay to think about. It was evident that the edge had
been taken off the animal's appetite. It was evident he did not meditate
an attack; and that had the horsemen chosen to make a d&eacute;tour,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
and ride peacefully away, they might have continued their journey
without ever seeing or hearing of him again.</p>

<p>But the field-cornet had no such intention. He had lost his precious
oxen and cattle. <i>That</i> lion had pulled down some of them, at least.
The Dutch blood was up, and if the beast had been the strongest and
fiercest of his tribe, he was bound to be brought out of that bush.</p>

<p>Ordering the others to remain where they were, Von Bloom advanced
on horseback until within about fifty paces of where the lion lay.
Here he drew up, coolly dismounted, passed the bridle over his arm,
stuck his loading-rod into the ground, and knelt down behind it.</p>

<p>You will fancy he would have been safer to have kept his saddle, as
the lion cannot overtake a horse. True; but the lion would have been
safer too. It is no easy matter to fire correctly from any horse; but
when the mark happens to be a grim lion, he is a well-trained steed
that will stand sufficiently firm to admit of a true aim. A shot from
the saddle under such circumstances is a mere chance shot; and the
field-cornet was not in the mood to be satisfied with a chance shot.
Laying his roer athwart the loading-rod, and holding the long barrel
steady against it, he took deliberate aim through the ivory sights.</p>

<p>During all this time the lion had not stirred. The bush was between
him and the hunter; but he could hardly have believed that
it sufficed to conceal him. Far from it. His yellow flanks were distinctly
visible through the thorny twigs, and his head could be seen
with his muzzle and whiskers stained red with the blood of the oxen.</p>

<p>No&mdash;he did not believe himself hid. A slight growl, with one or
two shakes of his tail, proved the contrary. He lay still, however,
as lions usually do, until more nearly approached. The hunter, as
already stated, was full fifty yards from him.</p>

<p>Excepting the motion of his tail, he made no other until Von
Bloom pulled trigger; and then with a scream he sprang several
feet into the air. The hunter had been afraid of the twigs causing
his bullet to glance off; but it was plain it had told truly, for he saw
the fur fly from the side of the lion where it struck him.</p>

<p>It was but a wound; and not deadly, as soon appeared.</p>

<p>With long bounds the angry brute came on&mdash;lashing his tail, and
showing his fearful teeth. His mane, now on end, seemed to have
doubled his size. He looked as large as a bull!</p>

<p>In a few seconds' time he had crossed the distance that separated
him from the hunter, but the latter was gone far from that spot.
The moment he had delivered his fire, he leaped upon his well-trained
horse, and rode off towards the others.</p>

<p>All three were for a short while together&mdash;Hendrik holding his
y&auml;ger cocked and ready, while Swartboy grasped his bow and
arrows. But the lion dashed forward before either could fire; and
they were obliged to spur and gallop out of his way.</p>

<p>Swartboy had ridden to one side, while Von Bloom and Hendrik
took the other; and the game was now between the two parties&mdash;both
of which had pulled up at some distance off.</p>

<p>The lion, after the failure of his charge, halted, and looked first at
one, then at the other&mdash;as if uncertain which to pursue.</p>

<p>His appearance at this moment was terrible beyond expression.
His whole fierce nature was roused. His mane stood erect&mdash;his tail
lashed his flanks&mdash;his mouth, widely open, showed the firm-set
trenchant teeth&mdash;their white spikes contrasting with the red blood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
that clotted his cheeks and snout, while his angry roaring added
horror to his appearance.</p>

<p>But none of the three were terrified out of their senses. Hendrik
at this moment covered him with his rifle, took cool aim, and fired;
while at the same instant Swartboy sent an arrow whistling through
the air.</p>

<p>Both had aimed truly. Both bullet and arrow struck; and the
shaft of the latter could be seen sticking in the lion's thigh.</p>

<p>The fierce brute that up to this time had exhibited the most
determined courage, now seemed overcome with a sudden fear.
Either the arrow or one of the bullets must have sickened him with
the combat; for, dropping his mop-like tail to a level with the line
of his back, he broke away; and, trotting sulkily forward, sprang in
at the door of the kraal!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE LION IN THE TRAP.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>here was something singular in the lion seeking shelter in so unusual
a place; but it showed his sagacity. There was no other cover
within convenient distance, and to have reached any bush that would
have afforded him concealment, since the passage of the locusts,
would have been difficult. The mounted hunters could easily have
overtaken him, had he attempted to run off. He was aware that the
house was uninhabited. He had been prowling around it all the night&mdash;perhaps
within it&mdash;and therefore knew what sort of a place it was.</p>

<p>The brute's instinct was correct. The walls of the house would
protect him from the guns of his enemies at a distance; and for
these to approach near would be his advantage and their danger.</p>

<p>An odd incident occurred as the lion entered the kraal. There
was a large window in one end of the house. Of course it was not
glazed&mdash;it never had been. A glass window is a rarity in these parts.
A strong wooden shutter alone closed it. This was still hanging on
its hinges, but in the hurried &ldquo;flitting,&rdquo; the window had been left
open. The door also had been standing ajar. As the lion sprang in
at the latter, a string of small foxy wolf-like creatures came pouring
out through the former, and ran with all their might across the
plain. They were jackals!</p>

<p>As it afterwards appeared, one of the oxen had either been chased
into the house by lions or hyenas, and killed there. His carcass had
been overlooked by the larger carnivora, and the cunning jackals had
been making a quiet breakfast upon it, when so unceremoniously
disturbed.</p>

<p>The entrance of their terrible king in such angry mood, by the
door, caused the fox-wolves to beat a quick retreat by the window;
and the appearance of the horsemen without had still further
frightened these cowardly brutes, so that they ran away from the
kraal at top speed, and never halted until they were out of sight!</p>

<p>The three hunters could not restrain a laugh; but their tone was
suddenly changed by another incident that happened almost at the
same moment.</p>

<p>Von Bloom had brought with him his two fine dogs, to assist in
driving back the cattle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span></p>

<p>During the short halt the party had made by the spring, these had
fastened upon a half-eaten carcass behind the walls; and, being extremely
hungry, had stuck to it, even after the horsemen had ridden
off. Neither of the dogs had seen the lion, until the moment when
the savage brute charged forward, and was making for the kraal.
The shots, the growling of the lion, and the loud wings of the vultures
as they flew off affrighted, told the dogs that something was going on
in front, at which they ought to be present; and, forsaking their
pleasant meal, both came bounding over the walls.</p>

<p>They reached the open space in front, just as the lion leaped into
the door; and without hesitation the brave noble animals rushed on,
and followed him inside the house.</p>

<p>For some moments there was heard a confused chorus of noises&mdash;the
barking and worrying of the dogs, the growling and roaring of
the lion. Then a dull sound followed as of some heavy object dashed
against the wall. Then came a mournful howl&mdash;another, another&mdash;a
noise like the crackling of bones&mdash;the &ldquo;purr&rdquo; of the great brute with
its loud rough bass&mdash;and then a deep silence. The struggle was
over. This was evident, as the dogs no longer gave tongue. Most
likely they were killed.</p>

<p>The hunters remained watching the door with feelings of intense
anxiety. The laugh had died upon their lips, as they listened to
those hideous sounds, the signs of the fearful combat. They called
their dogs by name. They hoped to see them issue forth, even if
wounded. But no. The dogs came not forth&mdash;they never came
forth&mdash;they were dead!</p>

<p>A long-continued silence followed the noise of the conflict. Von
Bloom could no longer doubt that his favourite and only dogs had
been killed.</p>

<p>Excited by this new misfortune he almost lost prudence. He was
about to rush forward to the door, where he might deliver his fire
close to the hated enemy, when a bright idea came into the brain of
Swartboy; and the Bushman was heard calling out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baas! baas! we shut him up! we close da skellum up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was good sense in this suggestion&mdash;there was plausibility in
it. Von Bloom saw this; and, desisting from his previous intention,
he determined to adopt Swartboy's plan.</p>

<p>But how was it to be executed? The door still hung upon its
hinges, as also the window-shutter. If they could only get hold of
these, and shut them fast, they would have the lion secure, and
might destroy him at their leisure.</p>

<p>But how to shut either door or window in safety? That was the
difficulty that now presented itself.</p>

<p>Should they approach either, the lion would be certain to see them
from within; and, enraged as he now was, would be sure to spring
upon them. Even if they approached on horseback to effect their
purpose, they would not be much safer. The horses would not stand
quiet while they stretched out to lay hold of latch or handle. All
three of the animals were already dancing with excitement. They
knew the lion was inside, an occasional growl announced his presence
there&mdash;they would not approach either door or window with sufficient
coolness; and their stamping and snorting would have the effect of
bringing the angry beast out upon them.</p>

<p>It was clear, then, that to shut either door or window would be an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
operation of great danger. So long as the horsemen were in open
ground, and at some distance from the lion, they had no cause to
fear; but should they approach near and get entangled among the
walls, some one of them would be most likely to fall a victim to the
ferocious brute.</p>

<p>Low as may be the standard of a Bushman's intellect, there is
a species peculiar to him in which he appears to excel. In all
matters of hunter-craft, his intelligence, or instinct you might
almost call it, is quite a match for the more highly-developed mind
of the Caucasian. This arises, no doubt, from the keen and frequent
exercise of those particular faculties,&mdash;keen and frequent, because
his very existence often depends on their successful employment.</p>

<p>Huge ill-shapen head that Swartboy carried on his shoulders,
there was an ample stock of brains in it; and a life of keen endeavour
to keep his stomach supplied had taught him their exercise. At that
moment Swartboy's brains came to the relief of the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baas!&rdquo; he said, endeavouring to restrain the impatience of his
master, &ldquo;vyacht um bige, mein baas! Leave it to da ole Bushy to
close da door. He do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired Von Bloom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vyacht um bige, mein baas! no long to wait,&mdash;you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All three had ridden up together within less than an hundred
yards of the kraal. Von Bloom and Hendrik sat silent, and watched
the proceedings of the Bushman.</p>

<p>The latter drew from his pocket a clue of small cord, and, having
carefully uncoiled it, attached one end to an arrow. He then rode
up to within thirty yards of the house, and dismounted&mdash;not
directly opposite the entrance, but a little to one side&mdash;so that the
face of the wooden door, which was fortunately but three-quarters
open, was thus fair before him. Keeping the bridle over his arm,
he now bent his bow, and sent the arrow into the woodwork of the
door. There it was, sticking near the edge, and just under the
latch!</p>

<p>As soon as Swartboy delivered the shaft, he had leaped back into
his saddle&mdash;to be ready for retreat in case the lion should charge
out. He still, however, kept hold of the string, one end of which
was attached to the arrow.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;thud&rdquo; of the arrow, as it struck the door, had drawn the
attention of the lion. Of course, none of them saw him, but his
angry growl told them that it was so. He did not show himself,
however, and was again silent.</p>

<p>Swartboy now drew the string taut,&mdash;first felt it with a steady
pull; and then, satisfied of its strength, gave it a stronger jerk, and
brought the door to. The latch acted beautifully, and the door
remained shut even after the strain was taken off the cord.</p>

<p>To have opened the door now the lion must have had the sagacity
to lift the latch, or else must have broken through the thick, strong
planks&mdash;neither of which things was to be feared.</p>

<p>But the window still remained open, and through it the lion could
easily leap out. Swartboy, of course, designed closing it in the
same manner as he had done the door.</p>

<p>But now arose a particular danger. He had only one piece of
cord. That was attached to the arrow that still stuck fast. How
was he to detach and get possession of it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span></p>

<p>There appeared to be no other way but by going up to the door
and cutting it from the shaft. In this lay the danger; for, should
the lion perceive him and rush out by the window, it would be all
over with the Bushman.</p>

<p>Like most of his race, Swartboy was more cunning than brave&mdash;though
he was far from being a coward. Still he was by no means
inclined at that moment to go up to the door of the kraal.</p>

<p>The angry growls from within would have made a stouter heart
than Swartboy's quail with fear.</p>

<p>In this dilemma Hendrik came to his relief. Hendrik had
conceived a way of getting possession of the string, without going
near the door!</p>

<p>Calling to Swartboy to be on his guard, he rode within thirty
yards of the entrance&mdash;but on the other side from where Swartboy
was&mdash;and there halted. At the place there stood a post with several
forks upon it, that had been used as a bridle-post.</p>

<p>Hendrik dismounted, hooked his rein over one of these forks;
rested his y&auml;ger across another; and then, sighting the shaft of the
arrow, pulled trigger. The rifle cracked, the broken stick was seen
to fly out from the door, and the string was set free!</p>

<p>All were ready to gallop off; but the lion, although he growled
fiercely on hearing the shot, still lay close.</p>

<p>Swartboy now drew in the string; and, having adjusted it to
a fresh arrow, moved round so as to command a view of the window.
In a few minutes the shaft had cut through the air and stuck deep
into the yielding wood, and then the shutter swung round on its
hinges, and was drawn close.</p>

<p>All three now dismounted, ran silently and rapidly up, and
secured both door and shutter with strong rheins of raw hide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! the lion was caged.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE DEATH OF THE LION.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">Y</span>es, the fierce brute was fairly in the trap. The three hunters
breathed freely.</p>

<p>But how was the affair to end? Both door and window-shutter
fitted strongly and closely; and, although it was possible to glance
through the chinks, nothing could be seen inside&mdash;since, both being
shut, it was quite dark within.</p>

<p>Even could the lion have been seen, there was no hole through
which to thrust the muzzle of a gun and fire at him. He was just as
safe as his captors; and, so long as the door remained closed, they
could do him no more harm than he could them.</p>

<p>They might leave him shut up, and let him starve. He could live
for a while upon what the jackals had left, with the carcasses of the
two dogs, but that would not sustain him long, and in the end he
would have to give up and miserably perish. After all, this did not
seem so certain to Von Bloom and his companions. Finding that he
was caged in earnest, the brute might attack the door, and with his
sharp claws and teeth manage to cut his way through.</p>

<p>But the angry field-cornet had not the slightest intention of leaving
the lion such a chance. He was determined to destroy the beast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
before leaving the ground; and he now set to thinking how this
could be accomplished in the speediest and most effectual manner.</p>

<p>At first he thought of cutting a hole in the door with his knife,
large enough to see through and admit the barrel of his roer. Should
he not succeed in getting a view of the beast through that one, he
would make another in the window-shutter. The two being on adjacent
sides of the house, would give him the command of the whole
interior&mdash;for the former dwelling of the field-cornet comprised only a
single apartment. During his residence there, there had been two,
thanks to a partition of zebra-skins; but these had been removed,
and all was now in one room.</p>

<p>At first Von Bloom could think of no other plan to get at the
enemy, and yet this one did not quite please him. It was safe
enough, and, if carried out, could only end in the death of the
lion.</p>

<p>A hole in both door and window-shutter would enable them to fire
at the brute as many bullets as they pleased, while they would be
quite secure from his attack. But the time that would be required
to cut these holes&mdash;that was why the plan did not please the field-cornet.
He and his party had no time to spare; their horses were
weak with hunger, and a long journey lay before them ere a morsel
could be obtained. No,&mdash;the time could not be spared for making a
breach. Some more expeditious mode of attack must be devised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Hendrik, &ldquo;suppose we set the house on fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Good. The suggestion was a good one. Von Bloom cast his eyes
up to the roof&mdash;a sloping structure with long eaves. It consisted of
heavy beams of dry wood with rafters and laths, and all covered
over with a thatch of rushes, a foot in thickness. It would make a
tremendous blaze, and the smoke would be likely enough to suffocate
the lion even before the blaze could get at him.</p>

<p>The suggestion of Hendrik was adopted. They prepared to fire
the house.</p>

<p>There was still a large quantity of rubbish,&mdash;the collected firewood
which the locusts had not devoured. This would enable them to
carry out their purpose; and all three immediately set about hauling
it up, and piling it against the door.</p>

<p>One might almost have fancied that the lion had fathomed their
design; for, although he had been for a long while quite silent, he
now commenced a fresh spell of roaring. Perhaps the noise of the
logs, striking against the door outside, had set him at it; and,
finding himself thus shut up and baited, he had grown impatient.
What he had sought as a shelter had been turned into a trap, and
he was now anxious to get out of it.</p>

<p>This was evident by the demonstrations he began to make. They
could hear him rushing about&mdash;passing from door to window&mdash;striking
both with his huge paws, and causing them to shake upon their
hinges&mdash;all the while uttering the most fiendish roars.</p>

<p>Though not without some apprehensions, the three continued
their work. They had their horses at hand, ready to be mounted in
case the lion might make his way through the fire. In fact, they
intended to take to their saddles&mdash;as soon as the fire should be fairly
under way&mdash;and watch the conflagration from a safe distance.</p>

<p>They had dragged up all the bush and dry wood, and had piled
them in front of the door. Swartboy had taken out his flint and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
steel, and was about to strike, when a loud scratching was heard
from the inside, unlike anything that had yet reached their ears.
It was the rattling of the lion's claws against the wall, but it had an
odd sound as if the animal was struggling violently; at the same
time his voice seemed hoarse and smothered, and appeared to come
from a distance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 357px;">
<img src="images/illus-350.jpg" width="357" height="500" alt="THE LION IN A FIX." title="THE LION IN A FIX." />
<span class="caption">THE LION IN A FIX.</span></div>

<p>What was the brute doing?</p>

<p>They stood for a moment, looking anxiously in each other's faces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>

<p>The scratching continued&mdash;the hoarse growling at intervals&mdash;but
this ended at length; and then came a snort, followed by a roar so
loud and clear, that all three started in affright. They could not
believe that walls were between them and their dangerous enemy!</p>

<p>Again echoed that horrid cry. Great Heaven! It proceeded no
longer from the inside&mdash;it came from above them!</p>

<p>Was the lion upon the roof?</p>

<p>All three rushed backward a step or two, and looked up. A sight
was before them that rendered them almost speechless with surprise
and terror.</p>

<p>Above the funnel of the chimney appeared the head of the lion;
his glaring yellow eyes and white teeth showing more fearful from
contrast with the black soot that begrimed him. He was dragging
his body up. One foot was already above the capstone; and with
this and his teeth he was widening the aperture around him.</p>

<p>It was a terrible sight to behold&mdash;at least to those below.</p>

<p>As already stated they were alarmed; and would have taken to
their horses, had they not perceived that the animal was stuck fast!</p>

<p>It was evident that this was the case, but it was equally evident
that in a few moments he would succeed in clearing himself from the
chimney. His teeth and claws were hard at work, and the stones
and mortar were flying in all directions. The funnel would soon be
down below his broad chest, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Von Bloom did not stay to think what then. He and Hendrik,
guns in hand, ran up near the bottom of the wall. The chimney
was but a score of feet in height; the long roer was pointed upward,
reaching nearly half that distance. The y&auml;ger was also aimed. Both
cracked together. The lion's eyes suddenly closed, his head shook
convulsively, his paw dropped loose over the capstone, his jaws fell
open, and blood trickled down his tongue. In a few moments he
was dead!</p>

<p>This was apparent to every one. But Swartboy was not satisfied,
until he had discharged about a score of his arrows at the head of
the animal, causing it to assume the appearance of a porcupine.</p>

<p>So tightly had the huge beast wedged himself, that even after
death he still remained in his singular situation.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances he would have been dragged down for
the sake of his skin. But there was no time to spare for skinning
him; and without further delay, Von Bloom and his companions
mounted their horses and rode off.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE TRAVELLERS BENIGHTED</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>ur travellers would have talked much about lions, but for the condition
of their horses. This made them feel uneasy. With the exception
of a few hours grazing, the poor brutes had been without
food since the appearance of the locusts. Horses do not travel well
upon soft grass, and of course they were now suffering severely.</p>

<p>It would be far in the night before the horsemen could reach the
camp&mdash;although they were pushing on as fast as the horses could
travel.</p>

<p>It was quite dark, when they arrived at the spot where they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
halted the previous evening. In fact, it was very dark. Neither
moon nor stars were to be seen in the sky; and thick black clouds
covered the whole canopy of the heavens. It looked as though a
rain-storm might be expected&mdash;still no rain had as yet fallen.</p>

<p>It was the intention of the travellers to halt at this place, and let
their horses graze a while. With this view they all dismounted; but,
after trying one or two places, they could find no grass!</p>

<p>This appeared strange, as they had certainly observed grass at
that very spot the day before. Now there was none!</p>

<p>The horses put their noses to the ground, but raised them up
again, snorting as they did so, and evidently disappointed. They
were hungry enough to have eaten grass had there been any, for they
eagerly snatched at the leaves of the bushes as they passed along!</p>

<p>Had the locusts been there also? No. The mimosa-bushes still
retained their delicate foliage, which would not have been the case
had the locusts visited the spot.</p>

<p>Our travellers were astonished that there was no grass. Surely
there was some the day before? Had they got upon a new track?</p>

<p>The darkness prevented them from having a view of the ground;
yet Von Bloom could not be mistaken about the route&mdash;having
travelled it four times already. Though he could not see the surface,
every now and again he caught a glimpse of some tree or bush,
which he had marked in his former journeys, and these assured him
they were still upon the right track.</p>

<p>Surprised at the absence of grass where they had so lately observed
it, they would have examined the surface more carefully; but
they were anxious to push on to the spring, and at length gave up
the idea of halting. The water in their gourds had been used up
long before this; and both they and their horses were once more suffering
from thirst.</p>

<p>Besides, Von Bloom was not without some anxiety about the
children at the wagon. He had been separated from them now a full
day and a half, and many a change might take place&mdash;many a danger
might arise in that time. In fact, he began to blame himself for
having left them alone. It would have been better to have let his
cattle perish. So thought he now. A presentiment that all was not
right was gradually forming in his mind; and he grew more anxious
to proceed as he reflected.</p>

<p>They rode on in silence. It was only on Hendrik expressing a
doubt about the way, that the conversation recommenced. Swartboy
also thought they were taking a wrong course.</p>

<p>At first Von Bloom assured them they were right; but after going
a little farther, he admitted that he was in doubt; and then, after
another half-mile's travelling, he declared that he had lost the track.
He could no longer recognise any one of the marks or bearings he had
taken.</p>

<p>The proper thing to be done under these circumstances was to
leave the horses to themselves; and this all three well knew. But
the animals were suffering the pangs of hunger, and when left to
themselves, would not journey forward, but rushed up to the mimosa-bushes,
and eagerly commenced devouring their leaves.</p>

<p>The consequence was, that their riders were obliged to keep them
going with whip and spur; and in that way there was no certainty
of the horses taking the right direction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span></p>

<p>After several hours' advancing, all the while in a state of suspense,
and as yet no appearance of either wagon or camp-fire, the travellers resolved
upon coming to a halt. It was of no use going forward. They
believed they could not be far from the camp; but they were now as
likely to be riding from as towards it; and they concluded at length,
that it would be wiser to remain where they were until the day broke.</p>

<p>They all dismounted therefore, and fastened their horses to the
bushes&mdash;so that the animals could browse upon the leaves till morning&mdash;which
could not now be very far off. They rolled themselves
up in their karosses, and lay down upon the earth.</p>

<p>Hendrik and Swartboy were soon asleep. Von Bloom would have
slept too, for he was tired enough; but the heart of the father was
too full of anxiety to allow repose to his eyes, and he lay awake
watching for the dawn.</p>

<p>It came at length, and at the first light his eyes swept the surface
of the surrounding country. The party had by chance halted on an
eminence that commanded a good view for miles on each side, but
the field-cornet had not glanced half around the circle, when an
object came before his eyes that brought gladness to his heart. It
was the white tent of the wagon!</p>

<p>The joyful exclamation he uttered awoke the sleepers, who immediately
sprang to their feet; and all three stood gazing at the
welcome sight.</p>

<p>As they continued to gaze, their joy gradually gave place to
feelings of surprise. Was it their wagon, after all?</p>

<p>It certainly looked like theirs; but it was a full half-mile off, and
at such a distance one wagon would look just like another. But
what led them to doubt its being theirs? It was the appearance of
the place in which they saw it. Surely it was not the same place in
which they had outspanned!</p>

<p>Theirs had been left in an oblong valley between two gentle ridges&mdash;in
such a valley was this one standing. Near a pool formed by a
spring&mdash;here, too, was the same, for they could perceive the water
shining. But in all other respects the situation was different. The
surface of the valley in which their wagon had been left was covered,
both sides and bottom, with a verdant carpet of grass; whereas the
one now before their eyes was brown and bare! Not a blade of
grass was to be seen&mdash;the trees seeming to be the only things that
had any verdure. Even the low bushes appeared to be destitute of
leaves! The scene had no resemblance whatever to that where they
had outspanned. It must be the camp of some other travellers,
thought they.</p>

<p>They had fully arrived at this conclusion, when Swartboy, whose
eyes had been rolling about everywhere, now rested upon the ground
at his feet. After a moment's observation&mdash;which the increasing
light now enabled him to make&mdash;he turned suddenly to the others,
and directed their attention to the surface of the plain. This they
saw was covered with tracks, as if a thousand hoofs had passed over
it. In fact, it presented the appearance of a vast sheep-pen; so
vast, that as far as their sight extended, they beheld the same
tracked and trampled appearance!</p>

<p>What could this mean? Hendrik did not know. Von Bloom was
in doubt. Swartboy could tell at the first glance. It was no new
sight to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, baas,&rdquo; he said, looking up in his master's face. &ldquo;Da's
da ole wagon!&mdash;da same spring an vley&mdash;da same place&mdash;dar hab
been um trek-boken!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A trek-boken!&rdquo; cried Von Bloom and Hendrik, in a breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ya, baas&mdash;a mighty big one too; das da spoor of dem antelope&mdash;See!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Bloom now comprehended all. The bareness of the country,
the absence of the leaves on the lower bushes, the millions of small
hoof-tracks, all were now explained. A migration of the springbok
antelope, a &ldquo;trek-boken,&rdquo; had swept over the spot. That it was that
had caused such a mighty change. The wagon they saw was theirs,
after all.</p>

<p>They lost no time, but, catching their horses, bridled them, and
rode rapidly down the hill.</p>

<p>Though somewhat relieved at seeing the wagon, Von Bloom was
still apprehensive.</p>

<p>As they approached, they perceived the two horses standing beside
it, and tied to the wheels, the cow also was there&mdash;but neither goats
nor sheep were in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>There was a fire burning in the rear of the hind-wheels, and a dark
mass underneath the wagon, but no human form could be observed.</p>

<p>The hearts of the horsemen beat loudly as they advanced. Their
eyes were bent earnestly upon the wagon. They felt keen anxiety.</p>

<p>They had got within three hundred yards, and still no one stirred&mdash;no
human form made its appearance. Von Bloom and Hendrik now
suffered intensely.</p>

<p>At this moment the two horses by the wagon neighed loudly; the
dark mass under the wagon moved, rolled outward, rose up, and
stood erect. Totty was recognised!</p>

<p>And now the &ldquo;after-clap&rdquo; of the wagon was hurriedly drawn
aside, and three young faces were seen peeping forth.</p>

<p>A shout of joy burst from the horsemen, and the next moment
little Jan and Tr&uuml;ey leaped out from the cap-tent into the arms of
their father&mdash;while the mutual congratulations of Hans and Hendrik,
Swartboy and Totty, produced for some moments a scene of
joyful confusion quite indescribable.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE TREK-BOKEN.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>hose who remained by the camp had had their adventures too;
and their tale was by no means a merry one, for it disclosed the unpleasant
fact, that the sheep and goats were all lost. The flock had
been carried off, in a most singular manner; and there was but
little hope of their ever being seen again.</p>

<p>Hans began his tale:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing unusual occurred on the day you left us. I was busy
all the afternoon in cutting 'wait-a-bit' thorns for a kraal. Totty
helped me to drag them up, while Jan and Tr&uuml;ey looked after the
flock. The animals did not stray out of the valley here, as the grass
was good, and they had had enough of trotting lately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;Totty and I got the kraal, as you see, all ready. So, when
night came, we drove the flock in; and, after milking the cow and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
getting our supper, we all went to bed. We were precious tired, and
all of us slept soundly throughout the night without being disturbed.
Both jackals and hyenas came around, but we knew they would not
break into that kraal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hans pointed to the circular enclosure of thorn-bushes, that had
been well constructed.</p>

<p>He then proceeded with his narration:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the morning we found everything right. Totty again milked
the cow; and we had breakfast. The flock was let out upon the
grass, and so were the cow and the two horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just about mid-day I began to think what we were to have for
dinner, for the breakfast had cleared up everything. I did not like
to kill another sheep, if it could be helped. So bidding Jan and
Tr&uuml;ey stay close by the wagon, and leaving Totty to look after the
flock, I took my gun and started off in search of game. I took no
horse, for I thought I saw springboks out on the plain; and I would
stalk them better afoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, there were springboks. When I got out of the
valley here, and had a better view, I saw what astonished me, I can
assure you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could scarce credit my eyes. The whole plain, towards the west,
appeared to be one vast crowd of animals; and by their bright yellow
sides, and the snow-white hair on their rumps, I knew they were
springboks. They were all in motion, some browsing along, while
hundreds of them were constantly bounding up into the air full ten
feet high, and leaping on top of each other. I assure you all it was
one of the strangest sights I ever beheld, and one of the pleasantest
too; for I knew that the creatures that covered the plain, instead of
being fierce wild beasts, were nothing but graceful and beautiful little
gazelles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My first thought was to get near them, and have a shot; and I was
about to start off over the plain, when I perceived that the antelopes
were coming towards me. I saw that they were approaching with
considerable rapidity; and if I only remained where I was, they
would save me the trouble of stalking in upon them. I lay down
behind a bush and waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not very long to wait. In less than a quarter of an hour the
foremost of the herd drew near, and in five minutes more a score of
them were within shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not fire for some time. I knew they would come still nearer;
and I lay watching the motions of those pretty creatures. I took
notice of their light handsome forms, their smooth slender limbs,
their cinnamon-coloured backs, and white bellies, with the band of
chestnut along each side. I looked at the lyre-shaped horns of the
bucks, and above all, at the singular flaps on their croup, that unfolded
each time that they leaped up, displaying a profusion of long
silky hair, as white as snow itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All these points I noticed, and at length, tired of admiring them, I
singled out a fine-looking doe&mdash;for I was thinking of my dinner, and
knew that doe-venison was the most palatable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After aiming carefully, I fired. The doe fell, but, to my astonishment,
and others did not fly off. A few of the foremost only galloped
back a bit, or bounded up into the air; but they again set to browsing
quite unconcerned, and the main body advanced as before!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I loaded as quickly as I could, and brought down another,&mdash;this
time a buck&mdash;but as before without frightening the rest!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I proceeded to load for the third time; but, before I had finished,
the front ranks had passed on both sides of me, and I found myself in
the midst of the herd!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw no need for covering myself any longer behind the bush, but
rose to my knees, and, firing at the nearest, brought it down also.
Its comrades did not pause, but ran over its body in thousands!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I loaded again, and stood right up on my feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the first time it occurred to me to reflect on the strange
conduct of the springboks; for, instead of making off at my appearance,
they only bounded a little to one side, and then kept on their
course. They seemed possessed by some species of infatuation. I
remembered hearing that such was their way when upon one of their
migrations, or &ldquo;trek-bokens.&rdquo; This, then, thought I, must be a &ldquo;trek-boken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was soon convinced of this, for the herd every moment grew
thicker and thicker around me, until at length they became so
crowded, that I began to feel very singularly situated. Not that I
was afraid of the creatures, as they made no demonstration of using
their horns upon me. On the contrary, they did all they could to get
out of my way. But the nearest only were alarmed; and, as my
presence in no way terrified those that were an hundred yards off,
the latter made no attempt to give ground. Of course the nearest
ones could only get a few paces from me, by pushing the others closer,
or springing up over their backs&mdash;so that with the ones thus constantly
bounding up into the air there was all the time a ring around
me two deep!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot describe the strange feelings I had in this unusual situation,
or how long I might have kept my place. Perhaps I might have
loaded and fired away for some time, but just at the moment the
sheep came into my mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They'll be carried away, thought I. I had heard that such a thing
was common enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw that the antelopes were heading towards the valley&mdash;the
foremost were already into it, and would soon be on the spot, where
I had just seen our little flock feeding!</p>

<p>&ldquo;In hopes of yet heading the springboks, and driving the sheep into
the kraal, before the former crowded on them, I started towards the
valley. But, to my chagrin, I could get no faster than the herd was
going!</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I approached the creatures, to make my way through their mass,
they leaped about and sprang over one another, but could not for
their lives open a way for me as fast as I wanted one. I was so near
some of them that I could have knocked them down with my gun!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I commenced hallooing, and, brandishing the gun about, I was
making a lane more rapidly, when I perceived in front what appeared
to be a large open space. I pushed forward for this, but the nearer
I came to its border the more densely I found the creatures packed.
I could only see that it was an open space by leaping up. I did not
know what was causing it. I did not stay to reflect. I only wished
to get forward as rapidly as possible, thinking about our flock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I continued to clear my way, and at length found myself in the
position I had coveted; while the lane I had made, in getting there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
closed instantaneously behind me. I was about to rush on and take
advantage of the bit of clear ground, when, what should I see in the
centre, and directly before me, but a great yellow lion!</p>

<p>&ldquo;That accounted for the break in the herd. Had I known what had
been causing it, I should have fought my way in any other direction
but that; but there was I, out in the open ground, the lion not ten
paces from me, and a fence of springboks two deep around both
of us!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need not say I was frightened, and badly too. I did not for some
moments know how to act. My gun was still loaded&mdash;for, after thinking
of saving our little flock, I did not care to empty it at the antelopes.
I could get one, thought I, at any time when I had secured the sheep in the kraal.
The piece, therefore, was loaded and with bullets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should I take aim at the lion, and fire? I asked myself this question,
and was just on the point of deciding in the affirmative, when I
reflected that it would be imprudent. I observed that the lion, whose
back was turned to me, had either not seen, or as yet took no notice
of me. Should I only wound him&mdash;and from the position he was in I
was not likely to do more,&mdash;how then? I would most likely be torn
to pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These were my reflections, all of which scarce occupied a second of
time. I was about to &ldquo;back out&rdquo; or back in among the springboks,
and make my way in some other direction, and had even got near the
edge, when, in looking over my shoulder, I saw the lion suddenly halt
and turn round. I halted too, knowing that to be the safest plan;
and, as I did so, I glanced back at the lion's eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my relief, I saw they were not upon me. He seemed to have
taken some fancy in his head. His appetite, perhaps, had returned;
for the next moment he ran a few yards, and then, rising with a
terrific bound, launched himself far into the herd, and came down
right upon the back of one of the antelopes! The others sprang right
and left, and a new space was soon opened around him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was now nearer than ever to where I stood, and I could see him
distinctly crouched over his victim. His claws held its quivering
body, and his long teeth grasped the poor creature by the neck. But,
with the exception of his tail, he was making not the slightest motion,
and that vibrated gently from side to side, just as a kitten that had
caught a tiny mouse. I could see, too, that his eyes were close shut,
as though he were asleep!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I had heard that under such circumstances the lion may be
approached without much danger. Not that I wished to go any
nearer&mdash;for I was near enough for my gun&mdash;but it was this recollection,
I believe, that put me in the notion of firing. At all events,
something whispered me I would succeed, and I could not resist
trying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The broad blind jaw of the brute was fair before me. I took aim,
and pulled trigger; but, instead of waiting to see the effect of my
shot, I ran right off in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not halt till I had put several acres of antelopes between
myself and the place where I had last stood; and then I made the
best of my way to the wagon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long before I had reached it, I could see that Jan, and Tr&uuml;ey, and
Totty, were safe under the tent. That gave me pleasure, but I also
saw that the sheep and goats had got mixed up with the springboks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
and were moving off with them as if they belonged to the same
species! I fear they are all lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the lion?&rdquo; inquired Hendrik.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yonder he lies!&rdquo; answered Hans, modestly pointing to a yellow
mass out upon the plain, over which the vultures were already
beginning to hover. &ldquo;Yonder he lies, you could hardly have done it
better yourself, brother Hendrik.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Hans said this, he smiled in such a manner as to show, that he
had no idea of making a boast of his achievements.</p>

<p>Hendrik was loud in acknowledging that it was a most splendid
feat, and also in regretting that he had not been on the ground to
witness the wonderful migration of the springboks.</p>

<p>But there was no time for much idle talk. Von Bloom and his party
were in a very unpleasant situation. His flocks were all gone. The
cow and horses alone remained; and for these not a blade of grass had
been left by the antelopes. Upon what were they to be fed?</p>

<p>To follow the spoor of the migratory springboks with the hope of
recovering their flock would be quite useless. Swartboy assured them
of this. The poor animals might be carried hundreds of miles before
they could separate themselves from the great herd, or bring their
involuntary journey to an end!</p>

<p>The horses could travel but little farther. There was nought to feed
them on but the leaves of the mimosas, and this was but poor food for
hungry horses. It would be fortunate if they could be kept alive
until they should reach some pasture; and where now was pasture to
be found? Locusts and antelopes between them seemed to have turned
all Africa into a desert!</p>

<p>The field-cornet soon formed his resolution. He would remain there
for the night, and early on the morrow set out in search of some other
spring.</p>

<p>Fortunately Hans had not neglected to secure a brace of the springboks;
and their fat venison now came into general use. A roast of
that, and a drink of cool water from the spring, soon refreshed the
three wearied travellers.</p>

<p>The horses were let loose among the mimosa-trees, and allowed to
shift for themselves; and although under ordinary circumstances they
would have &ldquo;turned up their noses&rdquo; at such food as mimosa-leaves,
they now turned them up in a different sense, and cleared the thorny
branches like so many giraffes.</p>

<p>Some naturalist as the &ldquo;Buffon&rdquo; school has stated that neither wolf,
fox, hyena, nor jackal, will eat the carcass of a lion,&mdash;that their fear
of the royal despot continues even after his death.</p>

<p>The field-cornet and his family had proof of the want of truth in
this assertion. Before many hours both jackals and hyenas attacked
the carcass of the king of beasts, and in a very short while there was
not a morsel of him there but his bones. Even his tawny skin was
swallowed by these ravenous creatures, and many of the bones broken
by the strong jaws of the hyenas. The respect which these brutes
entertain for the lion ends with his life. When dead, he is eaten by
them with as much audacity as if he were the meanest of animals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class="cap">SPOORING FOR A SPRING.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">V</span>on Bloom was in the saddle at an early hour. Swartboy accompanied
him, while all the others remained by the wagon to await his return.
They took with them the two horses that had remained by the wagon,
as these were fresher than the others.</p>

<p>They rode nearly due westward. They were induced to take this
direction by observing that the springboks had come from the north.
By heading westward they believed they would sooner get beyond the
wasted territory.</p>

<p>To their great satisfaction an hour's travelling carried them clear
of the track of the antelope migration! and although they found no
water, there was excellent grass.</p>

<p>The field-cornet now sent Swartboy back for the other horses and
the cow, pointing out a place where he should bring them to graze,
while he himself continued on in search of water.</p>

<p>After travelling some miles farther, Von Bloom perceived to the
north of him a long line of cliff rising directly up from the plain, and
running westward as far as he could see. Thinking that water would
be more likely to be found near these cliffs, he turned his horse's head
towards them. As he approached nearer to their base, he was charmed
with the beautiful scenery that began to open before his eyes. He
passed through grassy plains of different sizes, separated from each
other by copses of the delicate-leaved mimosa; some of these forming
large thickets, while others consisted of only a few low bushes. Towering
high over the mimosas, grew many trees of gigantic size, and of a
species Von Bloom had never seen before. They stood thinly upon
the ground; but each, with its vast leafy head, seemed a little forest
of itself.</p>

<p>The whole country around had a soft park-like appearance, which
contrasted well with the dark cliff that rose beyond&mdash;the latter stepping
up from the plain by a precipice of several hundred feet in height,
and seemingly as vertical as the walls of a house.</p>

<p>The fine landscape was gratifying to the eyes of the traveller&mdash;such
a fine country in the midst of so much barrenness; for he knew that
most of the surrounding region was little better than a wild karoo.
The whole of it to the north for hundreds of miles was a famous desert&mdash;the
desert of Kalihari&mdash;and these cliffs were a part of its southern
border. The &ldquo;vee-boer&rdquo; would have been rejoiced at such a sight
under other circumstances. But what to him now were all these fine
pastures&mdash;now that he was no longer able to stock them?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the beauty of the scene, his reflections were painful.</p>

<p>But he did not give way to despair. His present troubles were
sufficiently grievous to prevent him from dwelling much on the future.
His first care was to find a place where his horses might be recruited;
for without them he could no longer move anywhere&mdash;without them
he would be helpless indeed.</p>

<p>Water was the desired object. If water could not be found, all this
beautiful park through which he was passing would be as valueless to
him as the brown desert.</p>

<p>Surely so lovely a landscape could not exist without that most
essential element!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span></p>

<p>So thought the field-cornet; and at the turning of every new grove
his eyes wandered over the ground in search of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; he joyfully exclaimed as a covey of large Namaqua partridges
whirred up from his path. &ldquo;A good sign that: they are seldom far
from water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after, he saw a flock of beautiful pintados, or guinea-hens,
running into a copse. This was a still further proof that water was
nigh. But surest of all, on the top of a tall <i>cameel-doorn</i> tree, he next
observed the brilliant plumage of a parrot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; muttered he to himself, &ldquo;I must be very near to some spring
or pool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rode cheerfully forward: and after a little while arrived upon
the crest of an elevated ridge. Here he halted to observe the flight
of the birds.</p>

<p>Presently he noticed a covey of partridges flying in a westerly direction,
and shortly after, another covey going the same way. Both
appeared to alight near a gigantic tree that grew in the plain, about
five hundred yards from the bottom of the cliffs. This tree stood apart
from any of the others, and was by far the largest Von Bloom had yet
seen.</p>

<p>As he remained gazing at its wonderful dimensions, he observed
several pairs of parrots alighting upon it. These after chattering a
while among its branches, flew down upon the plain not far from its
base.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; thought Von Bloom, &ldquo;there must be water there. I shall
ride forward and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his horse had scarcely waited for him to form this design. The
animal had been already dragging upon the bridle; and as soon as
his head was turned in the direction of the tree, he started forward
with outstretched neck, snorting as he rushed along.</p>

<p>The rider, trusting to the instinct of his horse, surrendered up the
bridle; and in less than five minutes both horse and rider were drinking
from the sweet water of a crystal fountain that gushed out within
a dozen yards of the tree.</p>

<p>The field-cornet would now have hastened back to the wagon: but
he thought that by allowing his horse to browse an hour or so upon
the grass, he would make the return-journey with more spirit, and in
quite as good time. He, therefore, took off the bridle, gave the animal
his liberty, while he stretched himself under the shade of the great tree.</p>

<p>As he lay, he could not help admiring the wonderful production of
nature that towered majestically above him. It was one of the
largest trees he had ever beheld. It was of the kind known as the
&ldquo;nwana&rdquo; tree, a species of <i>ficus</i>, with large sycamore-shaped leaves
that grew thickly over its magnificent head. Its trunk was full
twenty feet in diameter, rising to more than that height without a
branch, and then spreading off into numerous limbs that stretched
far out in a horizontal direction. Through the thick foliage Von
Bloom could perceive shining egg-shaped fruits as large as cocoa-nuts;
and upon these the parrots and several other kinds of birds
appeared to be feeding.</p>

<p>Other trees of the same species stood out upon the plain at long
distances apart; and though they were all taller than the surrounding
timber, none were so large or conspicuous as the one that grew by
the spring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span></p>

<p>The field-cornet, as he enjoyed the cool shade which its umbrageous
frondage afforded, could not help thinking what an admirable spot
it would be to build a kraal. The inmates of a dwelling placed beneath
its friendly shelter, need never dread the fierce rays of the
African sun; even the rain could scarce penetrate its leafy canopy.
In fact, its dense foliage almost constituted a roof of itself.</p>

<p>Had his cattle still remained to him, no doubt the vee-boer would
have resolved at once to make this spot his future home. But,
tempting as it was, what now could he do in such a place? To him
it would be only a wilderness. There was no species of industry he
could follow in such a remote quarter. True, he might sustain himself
and his family by hunting. He saw that game was plenteous
all around. But that would be but a sorry existence, with no
promise for the future. What would his children do hereafter?
Were they to grow up with no other end than to become poor
hunters&mdash;no better than the wild Bushmen? No! no! no! To
make a home there would be out of the question. A few days to
recruit his wearied horses, and then he would make a struggle and
trek back to the settlements.</p>

<p>But what after he had got back? He knew not what then. His
future was gloomy and uncertain.</p>

<p>After indulging in such reflections for an hour or more, he bethought
him that it was time to return to the camp; and having
caught and bridled his horse, he mounted and set forth.</p>

<p>The animal, refreshed by the sweet grass and cool water, carried
him briskly along; and in less than two hours he came up with
Swartboy and Hendrik where they were pasturing the horses.</p>

<p>These were taken back to the wagon and harnessed in; and then
the great vehicle once more &ldquo;treked&rdquo; across the plains.</p>

<p>Before the sun had set, the long white cap-tent was gleaming
under the leafy screen of the gigantic &ldquo;nwana.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE TERRIBLE TSETSE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he verdant carpet that stretched away around them&mdash;the green
leaves upon the trees&mdash;the flowers by the fountain&mdash;the crystal water
in its bed&mdash;the black bold rocks towering up at a distance&mdash;all combined
to make a lovely picture. The eyes of the wayfarers were glad
as they beheld it; and while the wagon was outspanning, every one
gave utterance to their delightful emotions.</p>

<p>The place seemed to please every one. Hans loved its quiet and
sylvan beauty. It was just such a place as he would choose to ramble
in, book in hand, and dream away many a pleasant hour. Hendrik
liked it much, because he had already observed what he termed
&ldquo;extensive spoor&rdquo; about the spot: in other words, he had noticed
the tracks of many of Africa's largest wild animals.</p>

<p>Little Tr&uuml;ey was delighted to see so many beautiful flowers. There
were bright scarlet geraniums, and starlike sweet-scented jessamines,
and the gorgeous belladonna lily, with its large blossoms of rose-colour
and white; and there were not only plants in flower, but
bushes, and even trees, covered with gaudy and sweetly-perfumed
blossoms. There was the &ldquo;sugar-bush,&rdquo; the most beautiful of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
family, with its large cup-shaped corollas of pink, white, and green;
and there, too, was the &ldquo;silver-tree&rdquo; whose soft silvery leaves playing
in the breeze, looked like a huge mass of silken flowers; and there
were the mimosas covered with blossoms of golden yellow that filled
the air with their strong and agreeable perfume.</p>

<p>Rare forms of vegetation were around or near at hand: the arborescent
aloes, with their tall flower-spikes of coral red, and euphorbias
of many shapes; and <i>zamia</i>, with its palm-like fronds; and the soft-leaved
<i>Strelitzia regin&aelig;</i>. All these were observed in the neighbourhood
of this new-discovered fountain.</p>

<p>But what received little Tr&uuml;ey's admiration more than any other
was the beautiful blue water-lily, which is certainly one of the
loveliest of Africa's flowers. Close by the spring, but a little farther
in the direction of the plain, was a vley, or pool&mdash;in fact, it might
have been termed a small lake&mdash;and upon the quiet bosom of its
water the sky-blue corollas lay sleeping in all their gorgeous beauty.</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey, leading her little pet on a string, had gone down on the bank
to look at them. She thought she could never cease gazing at such
pretty things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope papa will stay here a long time,&rdquo; she said to her companion,
little Jan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I hope so too. Oh! Tr&uuml;ey, what a fine tree yon is! Look!
nuts as big as my head, I declare. Bless me, sis! how are we to
knock some of them down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the children conversed, both delighted with the new scenes
around them.</p>

<p>Although all the young people were inclined to be happy, yet they
were checked in their expression of it, by observing that there was
a cloud on the brow of their father. He had seated himself under
the great tree, but his eyes were upon the ground, as though he were
busy with painful reflections. All of them noticed this.</p>

<p>His reflections were, indeed, painful&mdash;they could not well have been
otherwise. There was but one course left for him&mdash;to return to the
settlements, and begin life anew. But how to begin it? What could
he do? His property all gone, he could only serve some of his richer
neighbours; and for one accustomed all his life to independence, this
would be hard indeed.</p>

<p>He looked towards his five horses, now eagerly cropping the luxuriant
grass that grew under the shadow of the cliffs. When would they
be ready to trek back again? In three or four days he might start.
Fine animals, most of them were&mdash;they would carry the wagon
lightly enough.</p>

<p>So ran the reflections of the field-cornet. He little thought at the
moment that those horses would never draw wagon more, nor any
other vehicle. He little thought that those five noble brutes were
doomed!</p>

<p>Yet so it was. In less than a week from that time, the jackals and
hyenas were quarrelling over their bones. Even at that very moment
while he watched them browsing, the poison was entering their veins,
and their death-wounds were being inflicted. Alas! alas! another
blow awaited Von Bloom.</p>

<p>The field-cornet had noticed, now and again, that the horses seemed
uneasy as they fed. At times they started suddenly, whisked their
long tails, and rubbed their heads against the bushes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Some fly is troubling them,&rdquo; thought he, and had no more uneasiness
about the matter.</p>

<p>It was just that&mdash;just a fly that was troubling them. Had Von
Bloom known what that fly was, he would have felt a very different
concern about his horses. Had he known the nature of that little
fly, he would have rushed up with all his boys, caught the horses in
the greatest hurry, and led them far away from those dark cliffs.
But he knew not the &ldquo;tsetse&rdquo; fly.</p>

<p>It still wanted some minutes of sunset, and the horses were permitted
to browse freely, but Von Bloom observed that they were
every moment getting more excited&mdash;now striking their hoofs upon
the turf,&mdash;now running a length or two&mdash;and at intervals snorting
angrily. At the distance they were off&mdash;a quarter of a mile or so&mdash;Von
Bloom could see nothing of what was disturbing them; but their
odd behaviour at length induced him to walk up to where they were.
Hans and Hendrik went along with him.</p>

<p>When they arrived near the spot, they were astonished at what
they then beheld. Each horse seemed to be encompassed by a swarm
of bees!</p>

<p>They saw, however, they were not bees, but insects somewhat
smaller, of a brown colour, resembling gad-flies, and exceedingly
active in their flight. Thousands of them hovered above each horse,
and hundreds could be seen lighting upon the heads, necks, bodies,
and legs of the animals,&mdash;in fact, all over them. They were evidently
either biting or stinging them. No wonder the poor brutes were
annoyed.</p>

<p>Von Bloom suggested that they should drive the horses farther out
into the plain, where these flies did not seem to haunt. He was
only concerned about the annoyance which the horses received from
them. Hendrik also pitied their sufferings; but Hans, alone of all
the three, guessed at the truth. He had read of a fatal insect that
frequented some districts in the interior of South Africa, and the
first sight of these flies aroused his suspicions that it might be
they.</p>

<p>He communicated his thoughts to the others, who at once shared
his alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call Swartboy hither!&rdquo; said Von Bloom.</p>

<p>The Bushman was called, and soon made his appearance, coming
up from the spring. He had for the last hour been engaged in unpacking
the wagon, and had taken no notice of the horses or the
interest they were exciting.</p>

<p>As soon, however, as he got near, and saw the winged swarm
whirring around the horses, his small eyes opened to their widest
extent, his thick lips fell, and his whole face yielded itself to an expression
of amazement and alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Swart?&rdquo; inquired his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mein baas! mein baas! der duyvel um da&mdash;dar skellum is da
'tsetse!'&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what if it be the tsetse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mein Gott!&mdash;all dead&mdash;dead&mdash;ebery horse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swartboy then proceeded to explain, with a loud and continuous
&ldquo;clicking,&rdquo; that the fly which they saw was fatal in its bite, that
the horses would surely die&mdash;sooner or later, according to the number
of stings they had already received; but, from the swarm of insects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
around them, the Bushman had no doubt they had been badly stung,
and a single week would see all five of the horses dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, mein baas&mdash;morrow show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to-morrow did show; for before twelve o'clock on the next
day, the horses were swollen all over their bodies and about their
heads. Their eyes were quite closed up; they refused any longer to
eat, but staggered blindly among the luxuriant grass, every now and
then expressing the pain they felt by a low melancholy whimpering.
It was plain to every one they were going to die.</p>

<p>Von Bloom tried bleeding, and various other remedies; but to no
purpose. There is no cure for the bite of the tsetse fly!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE LONG-HORNED RHINOCEROS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">G</span>reat, indeed, was now the affliction of the field-cornet. Fortune
seemed to be adverse in everything. Step by step he had been sinking
for years, every year becoming poorer in worldly wealth. He
had now reached the lowest point&mdash;poverty itself. He owned
nothing whatever. His horses might be regarded as dead. The cow
had escaped from the tsetse by avoiding the cliffs, and keeping out
upon the plain; and this animal now constituted his whole live stock,&mdash;his
whole property! True, he still had his fine wagon; but
of what use would that be without either oxen or horses? a wagon
without a team! Better a team without a wagon.</p>

<p>What could he do? How was he to escape from the position he
was placed in? To say the least, it was an awkward one&mdash;nearly
two hundred miles from any civilised settlement, and no means of
getting there,&mdash;no means except by walking; and how were his
children to walk two hundred miles? Impossible!</p>

<p>Across desert tracts, exposed not only to terrible fatigue, but to
hunger, thirst, and fierce carnivorous animals. It appeared impossible
that they could accomplish such a task.</p>

<p>And what else was there to be done? asked the field-cornet of himself.
Were they to remain there all their lives, subsisting precariously
on game and roots? Were his children to become &ldquo;Bush-boys,&rdquo;&mdash;himself
a Bushman?</p>

<p>With these reflections passing through his mind, no wonder that
Von Bloom felt deeply afflicted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merciful Heaven!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he sat with his head between
his hands, &ldquo;what will become of me and mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Von Bloom! he had reached the lowest point of his fortunes.</p>

<p>He had, in reality, reached the lowest point; for on that very day,&mdash;even
within that very hour&mdash;an incident occurred, that not only
gave relief to his afflicted spirit, but that promised to lay the foundation
of future wealth and prosperity. In one hour from that time
the prospects of the field-cornet had undergone a complete change,&mdash;in
one hour from that time he was a happy man, and all around him
were as happy as he!</p>

<p>You are impatient to hear how this change was effected? What
little fairy had sprung out of the spring, or come down from the cliffs,
to befriend the good field-cornet in his hour of misery? You are
impatient to hear! Then you shall hear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span></p>

<p>The sun was just going down. They were all seated under the
great tree, and near a fire, upon which they had cooked their supper.
There was no talking, no cheerful conversation,&mdash;for the children
saw that their father was in trouble, and that kept them silent. Not
a word passed between them, or only an occasional whisper.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Von Bloom gave utterance to his sad
thoughts in words as above.</p>

<p>As if seeking for an answer, his eyes were raised to heaven, and
then wandered around the plain. All at once they became fixed
upon a singular object, that appeared at some distance off, and was
just emerging from the bushes.</p>

<p>It was an animal of some kind, and from its vast size Von Bloom
and the others at first took it to be an elephant. None of them,
except Swartboy, were accustomed to elephants in their wild state,&mdash;for,
although these animals once inhabited the most southerly portion
of Africa, they have long since deserted the settled districts, and are
now only to be found far beyond the frontier of the colony. But
they knew that there were elephants in these parts&mdash;as they had
already observed their tracks&mdash;and all now supposed the huge
creature that was approaching must be one.</p>

<p>Not all, Swartboy was an exception. As soon as his eyes fell upon
the animal he cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chukuroo&mdash;a chukuroo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A rhinoster, is it?&rdquo; said Von Bloom, knowing that &ldquo;chuckuroo&rdquo;
was the native name for the rhinoceros, or &ldquo;rhinoster,&rdquo; as he called
it in Dutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ya, baas,&rdquo; replied Swartboy; &ldquo;and one o' da big karles&mdash;da,
'kobaoba,' da long-horn white rhinoster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What Swartboy meant by this was that the animal in question was
a large species of rhinoceros, known among the natives as the
&ldquo;kobaoba.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now I dare say, young reader, you have been all your life under
the impression that there was but one species of rhinoceros in the
world&mdash;that is <i>the</i> rhinoceros. Is it not so? Yes.</p>

<p>Well, permit me to inform you, that you have been under a wrong
impression. There are quite a number of distinct species of this very
singular animal. At least eight distinct kinds I know of; and I do
not hesitate to say that when the central parts of Africa have been
fully explored, as well as South Asia and the Asiatic islands, nearly
half as many more will be found to exist.</p>

<p>In South Africa four distinct species are well known; one in
North Africa differs from all these; while the large Indian rhinoceros
bears but slight resemblance to any of them. A distinct species from
any is the rhinoceros of Sumatra, an inhabitant of that island; and
still another is the Java rhinoceros, found in the island of Java. Thus
we have no less than eight kinds, all specifically differing from one
another.</p>

<p>The natives of South Africa are acquainted with four distinct
species of rhinoceros, to which they give distinct names; and it may
be remarked that this observation of species by native hunters is far
more to be depended upon than the speculations of mere closet-naturalists,
who draw their deductions from a tubercle, or the tooth,
or a stuffed skin. Gordon Cumming, for example, the most distinguished
of all African hunters has done more to increase the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
knowledge of African zoology than a whole college full of &ldquo;speculating&rdquo;
<i>savans</i>.</p>

<p>This same Gordon Cumming has written a most interesting account
of his hunting experiences, tells you that there are four kinds of
rhinoceros in Southern Africa; and no man is likely to know better
than he.</p>

<p>These four kinds are known among the natives as the &ldquo;borele,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;keitloa,&rdquo; the &ldquo;muchocho,&rdquo; and &ldquo;kobaoba.&rdquo; The two first are
&ldquo;black rhinoceroses,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the general colour of their skin is dark&mdash;while
the &ldquo;muchocho&rdquo; and &ldquo;kobaoba&rdquo; are white varieties, having
the skin of a dingy whitish hue. The black rhinoceroses are much
smaller&mdash;scarce half the size of the others, and they differ from them
in the length and set of their horns, as well as in other particulars.</p>

<p>In the form and length of their neck, the set of their ears, and
other respects, the black rhinoceroses differ materially from the white
ones. In fact, their habits are quite unlike. The former feed chiefly
on the leaves and twigs of thorns, such as the <i>Acacia horrida</i>, or
&ldquo;wait-a-bits,&rdquo; while the latter live upon grass. The former are of
fiercer disposition&mdash;will attack man or any other animal on sight;
and even sometimes seem to grow angry with the bushes, charging
upon them and breaking them to pieces!</p>

<p>The white rhinoceroses, although fierce enough when wounded or
provoked, are usually of pacific disposition, and will permit the
hunter to pass without molestation.</p>

<p>These become very fat, and make excellent eating. The flesh of no
African animal is esteemed superior to the calf of the white rhinoceros,
whereas the black varieties never grow fat, and their flesh is tough
and unpalatable.</p>

<p>The hide is also used for different purposes, among others for making
the whips known as &ldquo;jamboks,&rdquo; though hippopotamus-hide is
superior.</p>

<p>The skin of the African rhinoceros, as already stated, is without
the plaits, folds, and scutell&aelig;, that characterise its Asiatic congener,
yet it is far from being a soft one. It is so thick and difficult to
pierce, that a bullet of ordinary lead will sometimes flatten upon it.
To ensure its penetrating, the lead must be hardened with solder.</p>

<p>The rhinoceros, though not a water animal, like the hippopotamus,
is nevertheless fond of that element, and is rarely found at a great
distance from it. All four kinds love to lie and wallow in mud, just
as hogs in a summer's day; and they are usually seen coated all over
with this substance. During the day they may be observed lying
down or standing under the shade of some thick mimosa-tree, either
asleep or in a state of easy indolence; and it is during the night that
they wander about in search of food and water.</p>

<p>If approached from the lee side they can easily be got at, as their
small sparkling eyes do not serve them well. On the contrary, if the
hunter go to windward, they will scent him at a great distance, as
their sense of smell is most acute. If their eyes were only as keen as
their nostrils, it would be a dangerous game to attack them, for they
can run with sufficient rapidity to overtake a horse in the first charge.</p>

<p>In charging and running, the black variety far excels the white.
They are easily avoided, however, by the hunter springing quickly to
one side, and letting them rush blindly on.</p>

<p>The black rhinoceros is about six feet high at the shoulder, and full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
thirteen in length; while the white kinds are far larger. The white
rhinoceros is full seven feet high, and fourteen in length!</p>

<p>No wonder that an animal of these extraordinary dimensions was
at first sight taken for the elephant. In fact, the kobaoba rhinoceros
is the quadruped next to the elephant in size; and with his great
muzzle&mdash;full eighteen inches broad&mdash;his long clumsy head, his vast
ponderous body, this animal impresses one with an idea of strength
and massive grandeur as great, and some say greater than the elephant
himself. He looks, indeed, like a caricature of the elephant. It was
not such a bad mistake, then, when our people by the wagon took
the &ldquo;kobaoba&rdquo; for the &ldquo;mighty elephant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swartboy, however, set them all right by declaring that the animal
they saw was the white rhinoceros.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="cap">A HEAVY COMBAT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">W</span>hen they first saw the kobaoba, he was, as stated, just coming out
of the thicket. Without halting, he headed in the direction of the
vley already mentioned; and kept on towards it, his object evidently
being to reach the water.</p>

<p>This little lake, of course, owed its existence to the spring&mdash;though
it was full two hundred yards from the latter&mdash;and about the same
from the great tree. It was nearly circular in shape, and about one
hundred yards in diameter, so that its superficial area would thus be
a little over two English acres. It merited, then, the name of &ldquo;lake;&rdquo;
and by that name the young people already called it.</p>

<p>On its upper side&mdash;that in the direction of the spring&mdash;its shore
was high, and in one or two places rocky, and these rocks ran back
to the spring along the channel of a little rivulet. On the west or
outer side of the lake the land lay lower, and the water at one or two
points lipped up nearly to the level of the plain. For this reason it
was, that upon that side, the bank was paddled all over with tracks
of animals that had been to drink. Hendrik the hunter had observed
among them the footprints of many kinds he knew nothing about.</p>

<p>It was for the lower end of the lake the kobaoba was making&mdash;no
doubt with him an old and favourite drinking place.</p>

<p>There was a point where the water was easier of access than elsewhere&mdash;a
little to one side of where the wash or waste-stream of the
lake ran out. It was a sort of cove with bright sandy beach, and
approachable from the plain by a miniature gorge, hollowed out, no
doubt, by the long usage of those animals who came to drink at the
vley. By entering this cove, the tallest animals might get deep water
and good bottom, so that they could drink without much straining
or stooping. The kobaoba came on in a direct line for the lake; and
as he drew near, they could see him heading for the gorge that led
into the little cove. It proved he had been there before.</p>

<p>Next moment he passed through the gap, and stood knee-deep in
the water.</p>

<p>After swallowing several copious draughts&mdash;now sneezing, and then
wheezing&mdash;he plunged his broad snout, horn and all, into the water,
tossed it till it foamed, and then lying down in it, commenced wallowing
like a hog.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span></p>

<p>The place was shallow, and most of his huge body was above the
surface&mdash;though there was deep enough water in the lake to have
given him a bath had he desired it.</p>

<p>The first thought of Von Bloom, as well as of Hendrik, was how to
&ldquo;circumvent&rdquo; the rhinoceros, and of course destroy him. Not that
they simply wished his destruction; but Swartboy had already
represented what fine food the species was, and there was no stock
of provision in camp. Hendrik had another object in wishing the
death of the creature. He wanted a new loading-rod for his rifle;
and he had gazed covetously at the kobaoba's long horn.</p>

<p>But it was easier to desire the death of the rhinoceros than to
accomplish it. They had no horses&mdash;at least, none that could be
mounted&mdash;and to attack the animal on foot, would be a game as
dangerous as idle. He would be like enough to impale one of them
on his great spike, or else trample them brutally under his huge feet.
If he did not do one or the other, he would easily make his escape&mdash;as
any kind of rhinoceros can outrun a man.</p>

<p>How were they to manage him then?</p>

<p>Perhaps they might get near&mdash;fire at him from an ambush, and with
a lucky shot stretch him out. A single bullet sometimes kills the
rhinoceros&mdash;but only when correctly placed, so as to penetrate the
heart, or some other of the &ldquo;vitals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was, probably, the best plan. They might easily get near
enough. There was some bush cover close to the spot. It was probable
the old kobaoba would not perceive them, if they approached
from leeward, particularly as he seemed in the full tide of enjoyment
at that moment.</p>

<p>They were about to attempt the approach, and had got to their feet
for that purpose, when a sudden fit seemed to have attacked Swartboy.
The latter commenced jumping over the ground, at the same time
muttering in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Da klow! da klow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A stranger would have fancied Swartboy in a fit, but Von Bloom
knew that by &ldquo;Da klow! da klow!&rdquo; the Bushman meant &ldquo;The
elephant! the elephant!&rdquo; and therefore looked in the direction in
which Swartboy was pointing.</p>

<p>Sure enough, upon the western plain, looming up against the yellow
sky, was a dark mass, that upon examination presented the outlines
of an elephant. Its rounded back was easily distinguished over the
low bushes; and its broad hanging ears were moving as it marched.
All saw at a glance that it was coming towards the lake, and almost
in the same track that the rhinoceros had taken.</p>

<p>Of course this new apparition quite disarranged the plans of the
hunters. At sight of the mighty elephant, they scarce any longer gave
a thought to the kobaoba. Not that they had formed any very great
hopes of being able to kill the gigantic animal, yet some such thought
was running through their minds. They had determined to try, at all
events.</p>

<p>Before they could agree upon any plan, however, the elephant had
got up to the edge of the lake. Though moving only at a slow walk,
with his immense strides he soon measured off a large quantity of
ground, and advanced much more rapidly than one would have
supposed. The hunters had scarce time to exchange thoughts, before
the huge creature was up within a few yards of the water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span></p>

<p>Here he halted, pointed his proboscis in different directions, stood
quite silent, and seemed to listen.</p>

<p>There was no noise to disturb him&mdash;even the kobaoba for the moment
was quiet.</p>

<p>After standing a minute or so, the huge creature moved forward
again, and entered the gorge already described.</p>

<p>They at the camp had now a full view of him, at less than three
hundred yards distant. An immense mass he seemed. His body quite
filled the gorge from side to side, and his long yellow tusks projecting
more than two yards from his jaws, curved gracefully upward. He
was an &ldquo;old bull,&rdquo; as Swartboy whispered.</p>

<p>Up to this time the rhinoceros had not had the slightest intimation
of the elephant's approach; for the tread of the latter&mdash;big beast as
he is&mdash;is as silent as a cat's. It is true that a loud rumbling noise like
distant thunder proceeded from his inside as he moved along; but the
kobaoba was in too high a caper just then to have heard or noticed
any sound that was not very near and distinct.</p>

<p>The huge body of the elephant coming suddenly into &ldquo;his sunshine,&rdquo;
and flinging its dark shadow over the vley, was distinct enough, and
caused the kobaoba to get to his feet with an agility quite surprising
for a creature of his build.</p>

<p>At the same time a noise, something between a grunt and a whistle
escaped him, as the water was ejected from his nostrils.</p>

<p>The elephant also uttered his peculiar salute, in a trumpet note,
that echoed from the cliffs; and halted in his tracks as soon as he saw
the rhinoceros.</p>

<p>No doubt both were surprised at the rencontre; as both stood for
some seconds eyeing each other with apparent astonishment.</p>

<p>This, however, soon gave place to a different feeling. Symptoms of
anger began to show themselves. It was evident that bad blood was
brewing between them.</p>

<p>There was, in fact, a little dilemma. The elephant could not get
comfortably at the water unless the rhinoceros left the cove; and the
rhinoceros could not well get out of the cove, so long as the elephant
blocked up the gorge with his immense thick limbs.</p>

<p>It is true, the kobaoba might have sneaked through among the
other's legs, or he might have swum off and landed at some other point,
and in either way have left the coast clear.</p>

<p>But of all animals in the world a rhinoceros is, perhaps, the most
unaccommodating. He is, also, one of the most fearless, dreading
neither man nor beast&mdash;not even the boasted lion, whom he often
chases like a cat. Hence the old kobaoba had no intention of yielding
ground to the elephant; and from his attitude, it was plain that he
neither intended to sneak off under the other's belly, nor swim a single
stroke for him. No&mdash;not a stroke.</p>

<p>It remained to be seen how the point of honour was to be decided.
The attitude of affairs had become so interesting, that every one by
the camp was gazing with fixed eyes upon the two great bulls&mdash;for the
rhinoceros was also a &ldquo;bull&rdquo; and of the largest size known of his kind.</p>

<p>For several minutes they stood eyeing each other. The elephant,
although much the larger, knew his antagonist well. He had met his
&ldquo;sort&rdquo; before, and knew better than to despise his powers. Perhaps,
ere now, he had had a touch of that long spit-like excrescence that
stood out from the kobaoba's snout.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span></p>

<p>At all events, he did not rush upon his adversary at once&mdash;as he
would have done on some poor antelope that might have crossed him
in the same way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-370.jpg" width="500" height="357" alt="A DEADLY ENCOUNTER." title="A DEADLY ENCOUNTER." />
<span class="caption">A DEADLY ENCOUNTER.</span></div>

<p>His patience, however, became exhausted. His ancient dignity was
insulted&mdash;his rule disputed&mdash;he wished to have his bath and his drink&mdash;he
could bear the insolence of the rhinoceros no longer.</p>

<p>With a bellow that made the rocks ring again, he charged forward;
placed his tusks firmly under the shoulder of his adversary,&mdash;gave a
mighty &ldquo;lift,&rdquo; and turned the rhinoceros over in the water!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment the latter plunged, and blowed, and snorted, his head
half under water; but in a second's time he was on his feet again, and
charging in turn. The spectators could see that he aimed right at
the elephant's ribs with his horn, and that the latter did all he could
to keep head towards him.</p>

<p>Again the elephant flung the kobaoba, and again the latter rose and
charged madly upon his huge antagonist; and so both fought until
the water around them was white with foam.</p>

<p>The contest was carried on in the water, until the elephant, seeming
to think his adversary had an advantage there, backed himself into
the gorge, and stood waiting with his head towards the lake. In this
position the sides of the gorge did not protect him, as perhaps he
fancied. They were too low, and his broad flanks rose far above them.
They only kept him from turning round, and this interfered with the
freedom of his movements.</p>

<p>It could scarce have been design in the rhinoceros to act as he now
did, though it appeared so to those who were watching. As the
elephant took up his position in the gorge, the kobaoba clambered out
upon the bank; and then, wheeling suddenly, with head to the ground
and long horn projected horizontally, the latter rushed upon his
antagonist and struck him right among the ribs. The spectators saw
that the horn penetrated, and the loud scream that came from the
elephant, with the quick motions of his trunk and tail, told plainly
that he had received a severe wound. Instead of standing any longer
in the gorge he rushed forward, and did not stop until he was knee-deep
in the lake. Drawing the water up into his trunk, he raised it
on high, and pointing it backwards, he discharged large volumes over
his body, and upon the spot where he had received the thrust of the
kobaoba's horn.</p>

<p>He then ran out of the lake, and charged about in search of the
rhinoceros; but long-horn was no longer to be found!</p>

<p>Having escaped from the cove without compromising his dignity,
and perhaps believing that he had gained the victory, the rhinoceros,
as soon as he delivered the thrust, had galloped off and disappeared
among the bushes.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE DEATH OF THE ELEPHANT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he battle between these two large quadrupeds did not continue for
more than ten minutes. During that time the hunters made no advance
towards attacking either of them&mdash;so much absorbed were
they in watching the novel contest. It was only after the rhinoceros
had retreated, and the elephant returned to the water, that they once
more began to deliberate on some plan of assaulting this mightiest of
African animals. Hans now laid hold of his gun and joined them.</p>

<p>The elephant, after looking about for his enemy, had got back, and
was standing knee-deep in the lake. He appeared restless and
highly excited. His tail was continually in motion, and at intervals
he uttered a piercing melancholy scream&mdash;far different to the usual
trumpet-like bellow of his voice. He lifted his huge limbs, and then
plunged them back again to the bottom, until the foam gathered
upon the water with his continued churning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span></p>

<p>But the oddest of his actions was the manner in which he employed
his long tubular trunk. With this he sucked up vast volumes of
water, and then pointing it backwards ejected the fluid over his
back and shoulders, as if from an immense syringe. This shower-bath
he kept repeating time after time, though it was evident he was
not at his ease.</p>

<p>They all knew he was angry. Swartboy said it would be exceedingly
dangerous to be seen by him at that moment, without having a
horse to gallop out of his way. On this account every one of them
had concealed themselves behind the trunk of the nwana-tree, Von
Bloom peeping past one side, and Hendrik the other, in order to
watch his movements.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the danger, they at length resolved to attack
him. They believed that if they did not do so soon, he would walk
off, and leave them supperless&mdash;for they had hoped to sup upon a
slice of his trunk. Time, therefore, had grown precious, and they
resolved to attack him without further ado.</p>

<p>They intended to creep as near as was safe. All three would fire
together, and then lie close in the bushes until they saw the effect of
their shots.</p>

<p>Without farther parley, Von Bloom, Hans, and Hendrik, leaving
the tree, crept through the bushes towards the western end of the
lake. It was not a continuous thicket, but only an assemblage of
copses and clumps, so that they required to steal very cautiously
from one to the other. Von Bloom led the way, while the boys kept
in his tracks, following him closely.</p>

<p>After some five minutes spent in this way, they got under cover of
a little clump near the water's edge, and near enough to the gigantic
game. Upon their hands and knees they now approached the verge
of the underwood; and, having parted the leaves, looked through.
The mighty quadruped was right under their eyes, within twenty
yards of them!</p>

<p>He was still busy plunging about, and blowing volumes of water
over his body. He gave no sign that he had any suspicion of their
presence. They could take time, therefore, in choosing a part of his
huge body at which to aim their pieces.</p>

<p>When first seen from their new position, he was standing stern
towards them. Von Bloom did not think it a good time to fire, as
they could not give him a deadly wound in that situation. They
waited, therefore, until he might turn his side, before they should
deliver their volley. They kept their eyes all the while steadily
fixed on him.</p>

<p>He ceased at length to &ldquo;churn&rdquo; with his feet, and no longer raised
water in his trunk; and now the hunters perceived that the lake
was red for a space around him! It was his blood that had reddened
it.</p>

<p>They no longer doubted that he had been wounded by the rhinoceros;
but whether the wound was a bad one they could not tell.
It was in his side, and as yet they could only see his broad stern from
the position in which he still continued to stand. But they waited
with confidence&mdash;as they knew that in turning to get out of the
water, he would have to present his side towards them.</p>

<p>For several minutes he kept the same position; but they noticed
that his tail no longer switched about, and that his attitude was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
loose and drooping. Now and then he turned his proboscis to the
spot where he had received the thrust of the kobaoba's horn. It was
evident that the wound was distressing him, and this became more
apparent by the loud painful breathing the creature uttered through
his trunk.</p>

<p>The three began to grow impatient. Hendrik asked leave to creep
round to another point, and give him a shot that would turn him
round.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the elephant made a motion, as though he
was about to come out of the water.</p>

<p>He had got fairly round&mdash;his head and fore-part were over dry
land&mdash;the three guns were pointed&mdash;the eyes of the three hunters
were about to glance through the sights of their pieces, when all at
once he was seen to rock and stagger,&mdash;and then roll over! With a
loud plash, his vast body subsided into the water, sending great
waves to every corner of the lake.</p>

<p>The hunters uncocked their guns, and, springing from their ambush,
rushed forward to the bank. They saw at a glance that the
elephant was dead. They saw the wound upon his side,&mdash;the hole
made by the horn of the rhinoceros. It was not very large, but the
terrible weapon had penetrated far into his body, into his very
vitals. No wonder, then, at the result it had produced&mdash;the death of
the mightiest of quadrupeds.</p>

<p>As soon as it became known that the elephant was dead, everybody
was seen rushing forward to the spot. Little Tr&uuml;ey and Jan were
called from their hiding-place&mdash;for they had both been hidden in the
wagon&mdash;and Totty, too, went down with the rest. Swartboy was
one of the first upon the spot, carrying an axe and a large knife&mdash;for
Swartboy had designs upon the carcass&mdash;while Hans and Hendrik
both threw off their jackets to assist in the butchering operations.</p>

<p>And what during this time was Von Bloom about? Ha! That is
a more important question than you think for. That was an important
hour&mdash;the hour of a great crisis in the life of the field-cornet.</p>

<p>He was standing with folded arms on the bank of the lake, directly
over the spot where the elephant had fallen. He appeared to be
wrapt in silent meditation, his eyes bent upon the huge carcass of
the animal. No, not on the carcass. A close observer would have
perceived that his eyes did not wander over that mountain of thick
skin and flesh, but were resting upon a particular spot.</p>

<p>Was it the wound in the animal's side? And was Von Bloom
meditating how the thrust had caused the death of such a huge
creature?</p>

<p>Neither one nor the other. His thoughts were upon a very different
theme from either.</p>

<p>The elephant had fallen so that his head was clear of the water,
and rested upon a little bank of sand; along which, his soft and
limber trunk lay extended to its full length. Curving like a pair of
gigantic scimeters from its base, were the yellow enamelled tusks;
those ivory arms that for years,&mdash;aye centuries, perhaps,&mdash;had served
him to root up the trees of the forest, and rout his antagonists in
many a dread encounter. Precious and beautiful trophies were they,
but alas! their world-wide fame had cost no less than life to many
thousands of his race.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span></p>

<p>Shining in all their magnificence lay these mated crescents, gently
curved and softly rounded. It was upon these that the eyes of the
field-cornet were bent!</p>

<p>Aye, and bent too with an eagerness unusual in his glance. His lips
were compressed, his chest was visibly heaving. Oh! there was a world
of thoughts passing through the mind of Von Bloom at that moment.</p>

<p>Were they painful thoughts? The expression of his face told the
contrary. The cloud that all that day sat perched upon his brow
had vanished. Not a trace of it remained, but in its place could be
seen the lines of hope and joy, and these feelings at length found expression
in words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the hand of Heaven!&rdquo; he exclaimed aloud. &ldquo;A fortune&mdash;a
fortune!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, papa?&rdquo; inquired little Tr&uuml;ey, who was near him;
&ldquo;what were you speaking about, dear papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then all the others gathered around him, noticing his excited
manner, and pleased at seeing him look so happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, papa?&rdquo; asked all together, while Swartboy and Totty
stood eager as the rest to hear the answer.</p>

<p>In the pleasant excitement of his thoughts, the fond father could
no longer conceal from his children the secret of his new-born happiness.
He would gratify them by disclosing it.</p>

<p>Pointing to the long crescents he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see those beautiful tusks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, of course, they all did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do you know their value?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No. They knew they were worth something. They knew that it
was from elephants' tusks that ivory was obtained, or, more properly,
that elephants' tusks were ivory itself; and that it was used in the
manufacture of hundreds of articles. In fact, little Tr&uuml;ey had a
beautiful fan made out of it, which had been her mother's; and Jan
had a knife with an ivory handle. Ivory was a very beautiful
material, and cost very dear, they knew. All this they knew, but the
value of the two tusks they could not guess at. They said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my children,&rdquo; said Von Bloom, &ldquo;as near as I can estimate
them, they are worth twenty pounds each of English money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! Such a grand sum!&rdquo; cried all in a breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the field-cornet; &ldquo;I should think each tusk is one
hundred pounds in weight, and as ivory at present sells for four
shillings and sixpence the pound weight, these two would yield
between forty and fifty pounds of sterling money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it would buy a full span of best oxen!&rdquo; cried Hans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four good horses!&rdquo; said Hendrik.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A whole flock of sheep!&rdquo; added little Jan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But whom can we sell them to?&rdquo; asked Hendrik, after a pause.
&ldquo;We are away from the settlements. Who is to give us either oxen,
or horses, or sheep, for them? It would not be worth while to carry
two tusks all the way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not two, Hendrik,&rdquo; said his father interrupting him; &ldquo;but twenty
it might,&mdash;aye, twice twenty, or three times that number. Now, do
you understand what makes me so gay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Hendrik, as well as the others, who now began
to perceive what their father was so joyed about, &ldquo;you think we can
obtain more tusks in these parts?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely so. I think there are many elephants here. I feel
certain of it from the quantity of their spoor I have already noticed.
We have our guns, and fortunately, plenty of ammunition. We are
all pretty fair shots&mdash;why can we not obtain more of these valuable
trophies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we shall,&rdquo; continued Von Bloom. &ldquo;I know we shall, because
I recognise the hand of God in sending us this wealth in the midst of
our misery&mdash;after we had lost everything. More will come by the
guiding of the same hand. So be of good cheer, my children! We
shall not want&mdash;we shall yet have plenty&mdash;we may be rich!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not that any of those young creatures cared much about
being rich, but because they saw their father so happy, that they
broke out into something more than a murmur of applause. It was,
in fact, a cheer, in which both Totty and Swartboy joined. It rang
over the little lake, and caused the birds about settling to roost to
wonder what was going on. There was no happier group in all Africa
than stood at that moment upon the shore of that lonely little vley.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<div class="cap">TURNED HUNTERS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he field-cornet, then, had resolved upon turning hunter by profession&mdash;a
hunter of elephants; and it was a pleasant reflection to think,
that this occupation promised, not only exciting sport, but great
profit. He knew that it was not so easy a matter to succeed in killing
such large and valuable game as elephants. He did not suppose that
in a few weeks or months he would obtain any great quantities of
their ivory spoils; but he had made up his mind to spend even years
in the pursuit. For years he should lead the life of a Bushman&mdash;for
years his sons would be &ldquo;Bush-boys,&rdquo; and he hoped that in time his
patience and toil would be amply rewarded.</p>

<p>That night around the camp-fire all were very happy and very
merry. The elephant had been left where he lay, to be cut up on the
morrow. Only his trunk had been taken off&mdash;part of which was
cooked for supper.</p>

<p>Although all the flesh of the elephant is eatable, the trunk is
esteemed one of the delicate bits. It tastes not unlike ox-tongue;
and all of them liked it exceedingly. To Swartboy, who had made
many a meal upon &ldquo;de ole klow,&rdquo; it was a highly-relished feast.</p>

<p>They had plenty of fine milk, too. The cow, now upon the best of
pasture, doubled her yield; and the quantity of this, the most delicious
of all drinks, was sufficient to give every one a large allowance.</p>

<p>While enjoying their new-fashioned dish of roast elephant-trunk,
the conversation naturally turned upon these animals.</p>

<p>Everybody knows the appearance of the elephant, therefore a
description of him is quite superfluous. But everybody does not
know that there are two distinct kinds of this gigantic quadruped&mdash;the
African and Asiatic.</p>

<p>Until a late period they were thought to be of the same species.
Now they are acknowledged to be, not only distinct, but very different
in many respects. The Asiatic, or, as it is more frequently called, the
&ldquo;Indian&rdquo; elephant is the larger of the two; but it is possible that
domestication may have produced a larger kind, as is the rule with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
many animals. The African species exists only in a wild state; and
it would appear that individuals of this kind have been measured
having the dimensions of the largest of the wild Asiatic elephants.</p>

<p>The most remarkable points of difference between the two are
found in the ears and tusks. The ears of the African elephant are of
enormous proportions, meeting each other above the shoulders, and
hanging down below the breast. Those of the Indian elephant are
scarce one-third the size. In his grand tusks the former has far the
advantage&mdash;these in some individuals weighing nearly two hundred
pounds each&mdash;while the tusks of the latter rarely reach the weight of
one hundred. To this, however, there are some exceptions. Of course
a two hundred pound tusk is one of the very largest, and far above
the average even of African elephants. In this species the females
are also provided with tusks&mdash;though not of such size as in the males&mdash;whereas
the female of the Indian elephant has either no tusks at all,
or they are so small as to be scarcely perceptible outside the skin of
the lips.</p>

<p>In Africa the elephant exists only in a state of nature. None of
the nations upon this little-known continent tame or train him to
any purpose. He is only prized among them for his precious teeth,
and his flesh as well. Some have asserted that this species is more
fierce than its Indian congener, and could not be domesticated. This
is altogether a mistake. The reason why the African elephant is not
trained, is simply that none of the modern nations of Africa have yet
reached a high enough point of civilisation to avail themselves of the
services of this valuable animal.</p>

<p>The African elephant may be domesticated and trained to the
&ldquo;howdah,&rdquo; or castle, as easily as his Indian cousin. The trial has
been made; but that it can be done no better proof is required than
that at one period it was done, and upon a large scale. The elephants
of the Carthaginian army were of this species.</p>

<p>The African elephant at present inhabits the central and southern
parts of Africa. Abyssinia on the east, and Senegal on the west, are
his northern limits, and but a few years ago he roamed southward to
the very Cape of Good Hope. The activity of the Dutch ivory-hunters,
with their enormous long guns, has driven him from that
quarter; and he is no longer to be found to the south of the Orange
River.</p>

<p>Swartboy spoke of a variety well known among the Hottentot
hunters as the &ldquo;koes-cops.&rdquo; This kind, he said, differed from the
ordinary ones by its altogether wanting the tusks, and being of a far
more vicious disposition. Its encounter is more dreaded; but as it
possesses no trophies to make it worth the trouble and danger of
killing, the hunters usually give it a wide berth.</p>

<p>Such was the conversation that night around the camp-fire. Much
of the information here given was furnished by Hans, who of course
had gathered it from books; but the Bushman contributed his quota&mdash;perhaps
of a far more reliable character.</p>

<p>All were destined ere long to make practical acquaintance with the
haunts and habits of this huge quadruped, that to them had now
become the most interesting of all the animal creation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<div class="cap">JERKING AN ELEPHANT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">N</span>ext day was one of severe, but joyful labour. It was spent in
&ldquo;curing&rdquo; the elephant, not in a medical sense, but in the language of
the provision-store.</p>

<p>Although not equal to either beef or mutton, or even pork, the flesh
of the elephant is sufficiently palatable to be eaten. There is no
reason why it should not be, for the animal is a clean feeder, and
lives altogether on vegetable substances&mdash;the leaves and tender shoots
of trees, with several species of bulbous roots, which he well knows
how to extract from the ground with his tusks and trunk. It does
not follow from this that his beef should be well tasted&mdash;since we
see that the hog, one of the most unclean of feeders, yields most
delicious &ldquo;pork;&rdquo; while another of the same family (<i>pachydermata</i>)
that subsists only on sweet succulent roots, produces a flesh both
insipid and bitter. I allude to the South American tapir. The quality
of the food, therefore, is no criterion of the quality of the flesh.</p>

<p>It is true that the beef of the elephant was not what Von Bloom
and most of his family would have chosen for their regular diet. Had
they been sure of procuring a supply of antelope-venison, the great
carcass might have gone, not to the &ldquo;dogs,&rdquo; but to their kindred the
hyenas. But they were not sure of getting even a single antelope,
and therefore decided upon &ldquo;curing&rdquo; the elephant. It would be a
safe stock to have on hand, and need not interfere with their eating
venison, or any other dainty that might turn up.</p>

<p>The first thing done was to cut out the tusks. This proved a tough
job, and occupied full two hours. Fortunately there was a good axe
on hand. But for this and Swartboy's knowledge, double the time
might have been wasted in the operation.</p>

<p>The ivory having been extracted and put away in a safe place, the
&ldquo;cutting up&rdquo; then commenced in earnest. Von Bloom and Swartboy
were the &ldquo;baas-butchers,&rdquo; while Hans and Hendrik played the part
of &ldquo;swabs.&rdquo; As the carcass lay half under water, they would have
had some difficulty in dealing with the under part. But this they did
not design to touch. The upper half would be amply sufficient to provision
them a long while; and so they set about removing the skin from
that side that was uppermost.</p>

<p>The rough thick outer coat they removed in broad sheets cut into
sections; and then they peeled off several coats of an under skin, of
tough and pliant nature. Had they needed water-vessels, Swartboy
would have saved this for making them&mdash;as it is used for such purposes
by the Bushmen and other natives. But they had vessels enough in
the wagon, and this skin was thrown away.</p>

<p>They had now reached the pure flesh, which they separated in large
sheets from the ribs; and then the ribs were cut out, one by one, with
the axe. This trouble they would not have taken&mdash;as they did not
want the ribs&mdash;but they cut them away for another reason, namely,
to enable them to get at the valuable fat, which lies in enormous
quantities around the intestines. Of course for all cooking purposes,
the fat would be to them invaluable, and indeed almost necessary to
render the flesh itself eatable.</p>

<p>It is no easy matter to get at the fat in the inside of an elephant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
as the whole of the intestines have first to be removed. But Swartboy
was not to be deterred by a little trouble; so climbing into the interior
of the huge carcass, he commenced cutting and delving, and every now
and then passing a multitude of &ldquo;inwards&rdquo; out to the others, who
carried them off out of the way.</p>

<p>After a long spell of this work, the fat was secured, and carefully
packed in a piece of clean under-skin; and then the &ldquo;butchering&rdquo;
was finished.</p>

<p>Of course the four feet, which along with the trunk are considered
the &ldquo;tit-bits,&rdquo; had already been separated at the fetlock joint; and
stood out upon the bank, for the future consideration of Swartboy.</p>

<p>The next thing to be done was to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; the meat. They had a
stock of salt&mdash;that precious, though, as lately discovered, not indispensable
article. But the quantity&mdash;stowed away in a dry corner of
the wagon&mdash;was small, and would have gone but a short way in curing
an elephant.</p>

<p>They had no idea of using it for such a purpose. Flesh can be preserved
without salt; and not only Swartboy, but Von Bloom himself,
knew how to preserve it. In all countries where salt is scarce, the
process of &ldquo;jerking&rdquo; meat is well understood, and consists simply in
cutting it into thin strips and hanging it out in the sun. A few days
of bright warm sunshine will &ldquo;jerk&rdquo; it sufficiently; and meat thus
dried will keep good for months. A slow fire will answer the purpose
nearly as well; and in the absence of sunshine, the fire is often resorted
to.</p>

<p>Sun-dried meat in South Africa is called &ldquo;biltongue.&rdquo; The
Spaniards of Mexico name it &ldquo;tasajo,&rdquo; while those of Peru style it
&ldquo;charqui.&rdquo; In English it is &ldquo;jerked&rdquo; meat.</p>

<p>Several hours were spent in cutting the elephant-beef into strips,
and then a number of forked poles were set up, others were laid
horizontally over the forks, and upon these the meat was suspended,
and hung down in numberless festoons.</p>

<p>Before the sun went down, the neighbourhood of the camp presented
a rare appearance. It looked somewhat like the enclosure of a yarn-bleacher,
except that the hanging strips, instead of being white, were
of a beautiful clear ruby colour.</p>

<p>But the work was not yet completed. The feet remained to be
&ldquo;preserved,&rdquo; and the mode of curing these was entirely different.
That was a secret known only by Swartboy, and in the execution of
it the Bushman played first fiddle, with the important air of a <i>chef de
cuisine</i>.</p>

<p>He proceeded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>He first dug a hole in the ground, about two feet deep, and a little
more in diameter&mdash;just large enough to admit one of the feet, which
was nearly two feet diameter at the base. The earth which came out of
this hole Swartboy placed in the form of a loose embankment around
the edge.</p>

<p>By his direction the boys had already collected upon the spot a large
quantity of dried branches and logs. These Swartboy now built over
the hole, into a pyramid of ten feet high, and then set the pile on fire.
He next proceeded to make three other pits precisely similar, and built
over each a fire like the first, until four large fires were burning upon
the ground.</p>

<p>The fires being now fairly under way, he could only wait until each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
had burned down. This would carry the process into the night, and
so it turned out; but Swartboy had a foresight of this. He knew he
would get through with the more important portion of his work before
bedtime.</p>

<p>When the first fire had burned quite to red cinders, Swartboy's
hardest turn of duty began. With a shovel he lifted the cinders out
of the hole, until it was empty; but he was more than an hour in performing
this apparently simple labour. The difficulty arose from the
intense heat he had to encounter, which drove him back after every
few moments' work; so that he was compelled to retreat at intervals
in order to cool himself.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;baas,&rdquo; as well as Hendrik and Hans, took turns with him,
until all four were perspiring as if they had been shut up for half-an-hour
in a baker's oven.</p>

<p>When the hole was thoroughly scooped clean of coals, Swartboy,
assisted by Von Bloom, lifted one of the huge feet; and, carrying it
as near as they dare go on account of the scorching heat, they heaved
it in upon its base.</p>

<p>The sandy earth which had been originally removed, and which
was now as hot as molten lead, was pushed over, and around the foot;
and then the cinders were raked on top, and over that another huge
fire was kindled.</p>

<p>The same process was gone through with the other three feet, and
all four were to be left in the &ldquo;oven&rdquo; until the fires should be burned
down, when they would be found sufficiently &ldquo;baked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swartboy would then rake off the cinders, take out the feet with a
sharp wooden spit, beat them well to get rid of the dust, scrape the
sand clear, then pare off the outside skin, when they would be ready
either to be eaten or would keep for a long time.</p>

<p>Swartboy would do all this as soon as the four huge bonfires should
burn down.</p>

<p>But that would not be before the morning; so all of them, fatigued
by the extraordinary exertions of the day, finished their suppers of
broiled trunk, and went to rest under the protecting shadow of the
nwana.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE HIDEOUS HYENA.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">F</span>atigued as they were, they would soon have fallen asleep. But
they were not permitted to do so. As they lay with closed eyes in
that half-dreamy state that precedes sleep, they were suddenly
startled by strange voices near the camp.</p>

<p>These voices were uttered in peals of loud laughter; and no one,
unacquainted with them, would have pronounced them to be anything
else than the voices of human beings. They exactly resembled
the strong treble produced by the laugh of a maniac negro. It
seemed as if some Bedlam of negroes had been let loose, and were
approaching the spot.</p>

<p>I say approaching, because each moment the sounds grew clearer
and louder; and it was evident that whatever gave utterance to
them was coming nearer to the camp.</p>

<p>That there was more than one creature was evident&mdash;aye, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
was equally evident that there was more than one kind of creature;
for so varied were the voices, it would have puzzled a ventriloquist
to have given imitations of them all. There was howling, and
whining, and grunting, and growling, and low melancholy moaning
as of some one in pain, and hissing, and chattering, and short, sharp
intonations, as if it were the barking of dogs, and then a moment or
two of deep silence, and again that chorus of human-like laughter,
that in point of horror and hideous suggestions surpassed all the
other sounds.</p>

<p>You will suppose that such a wild concert must have put the camp
in a state of great alarm. Not a bit of it. Nobody was frightened
in the least&mdash;not even innocent little Tr&uuml;ey, nor the diminutive Jan.</p>

<p>Had they been strangers to these sounds, no doubt they would
have been more than frightened. They would have been terrified by
them; for they were calculated to produce such an effect upon any
one to whose ears they were new.</p>

<p>But Von Bloom and his family had lived too long upon the wild
karoo to be ignorant of those voices. In the howling, and chattering,
and yelping, they heard but the cries of the jackal; and they well
knew the maniac laugh of the hideous hyena.</p>

<p>Instead of being alarmed, and springing from their beds, they lay
still and listened&mdash;not dreading any attack from the noisy creatures.</p>

<p>Von Bloom and the children slept in the wagon; Swartboy and
Totty upon the ground&mdash;but these lay close to the fires, and therefore
did not fear wild beasts of any kind.</p>

<p>But the hyenas and jackals upon this occasion appeared to be both
numerous and bold. In a few minutes after they were first heard,
their cries rose around the camp on all sides, so near and so loud as
to be positively disagreeable&mdash;even without considering the nature
of the brutes that uttered them.</p>

<p>At last they came so close, that it was impossible to look in any
direction without seeing a pair of green or red eyes gleaming under
the light of the fires! White teeth, too, could be observed, as the
hyenas opened their jaws, to give utterance to their harsh laughter.</p>

<p>With such a sight before their eyes, and such sounds ringing in
their ears, neither Von Bloom nor any of his people&mdash;tired as they
were&mdash;could go to sleep. Indeed, not only was sleep out of the
question, but, worse than that, all&mdash;the field-cornet himself not excepted&mdash;began
to experience some feelings of apprehension, if not
actual alarm.</p>

<p>They had never beheld a troop of hyenas so numerous and fierce.
There could not be less than two dozen of them around the camp,
with twice that number of jackals.</p>

<p>Von Bloom knew that although, under ordinary circumstances, the
hyena is not a dangerous animal, yet there are places and times when
he will attack human beings. Swartboy knew this well, and Hans,
too, from having read of it. No wonder, then, that some apprehension
was felt by all of them.</p>

<p>The hyenas now behaved with such boldness, and appeared so
ravenous, that sleep was out of the question. Some demonstration
must be made to drive the brutes away from the camp.</p>

<p>Von Bloom, Hans, and Hendrik, laid hold of their guns, and got
out of the wagon, while Swartboy armed himself with his bow and
arrows. All four stood close by the trunk of the nwana, on the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
side from that where the fires were. In this place they were in the
shadow, where they could best observe anything that should come
under the light of the fires without being themselves seen. Their
position was well chosen.</p>

<p>They had scarcely fixed themselves in it, when they perceived a
great piece of neglect they had been guilty of. Now, for the first
time it occurred to them what had brought the hyenas around them
in such numbers. Beyond a doubt it was the flesh of the elephant,&mdash;the
<i>biltongue</i>.</p>

<p>That was what the beasts were after; and all now saw that a mistake
had been committed in hanging the meat too low. The hyenas
might easily get at it.</p>

<p>This was soon made manifest; for, even at the moment while they
stood watching the red festoons, plainly visible under the light of
Swartboy's fires, a shaggy spotted brute rushed forward, reared up
on his hind-legs, seized one of the pieces, dragged it down from the
pole, and then ran off with it into the darkness.</p>

<p>A rushing sound could be heard as the others joined him to get a
share of his plunder; and, no doubt, in less than half a minute the
morsel was consumed; for, at the end of that time, glancing eyes and
gleaming teeth showed that the whole troop was back again and
ready to make a fresh seizure.</p>

<p>None of the hunters had fired, as the nimbleness with which the
brutes moved about rendered it difficult to take aim at any one of
them; and all knew that powder and lead were too precious to be
wasted on a &ldquo;flying shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emboldened by their success, the hyenas had now drawn nearer,
and in a moment more would have made a general charge upon the
scaffolds of flesh, and, no doubt, would have succeeded in carrying
off a large quantity of it. But just then it occurred to Von Bloom
that it would be best to lay aside their guns and remedy the mistake
they had made, by putting the biltongue out of reach. If they
did not do so, they would either have to remain awake all night and
guard it, or else lose every string of it.</p>

<p>How was it to be put out of reach?</p>

<p>At first they thought of collecting it into a heap and stowing it
away in the wagon. That would not only be an unpleasant job, but
it would interfere with their sleeping quarters.</p>

<p>An alternative, however, presented itself. They saw that if the
scaffolds were only high enough, the meat might be easily hung so
as to be out of reach of the hyenas. The only question was, how to
place the cross-poles a little higher. In the darkness they could not
obtain a new set of uprights, and therein lay the difficulty. How
were they to get over it?</p>

<p>Hans had the credit of suggesting a way; and that was to take
out some of the uprights, splice them to the others, with the forked
ends uppermost, and then rest the horizontal poles on the upper
forks. That would give a scaffold tall enough to hang the meat
beyond the reach of either jackals or hyenas.</p>

<p>Hans' suggestion was at once adopted. Half of the uprights were
taken up and spliced against the others so as to raise their forks full
twelve feet in the air; and then the cross-poles were rested over
their tops. By standing upon one of the wagon-chests, Von Bloom
was able to fling the strips of meat over the horizontal poles, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
in such a manner that it hung only a few inches down, and was now
quite beyond the reach of the ravenous brutes.</p>

<p>When the business was finished, the party resumed their station
under the shadow of the tree, intending to watch for a while, and see
how the wolfish intruders would act.</p>

<p>They had not long to watch. In less than five minutes the troop
approached the biltongue, howling, and gibbering, as before; only
this time uttering peculiar cries, as if to express disappointment.
They saw at a glance that the tempting festoons were no longer
within their reach.</p>

<p>They were not going to leave the ground, however, without
assuring themselves of this fact; and several of the largest approached
boldly under the scaffolds, and commenced leaping up to
try the height.</p>

<p>After several attempts, springing each time as high as they were
able, they appeared to grow discouraged; and no doubt would in
time have imitated the fox with the grapes, and gone quietly away.
But Von Bloom, indignant at being roused after such a fashion, from
his pleasant rest, was determined to take some revenge upon his tormentors;
so he whispered the word to the others, and a volley was
delivered from behind the tree.</p>

<p>The unexpected discharge caused a quick scattering of both hyenas
and jackals, and the pattering of their numerous feet could be heard
as they ran off. When the ground under the scaffold was examined,
two of the larger of these ravenous quadrupeds, and one of the
smaller, were found to have bitten the dust.</p>

<p>Swartboy had discharged his arrow along with the guns, and it was
he that had slain the jackal, for the poisoned shaft was seen sticking
between the animal's ribs.</p>

<p>The guns were again loaded, the party took their stations as before;
but, although they waited another half-hour, neither hyena nor jackal
made their appearance.</p>

<p>They had not gone far away, however, as their wild music testified;
but the reason they did not return was, that they had now discovered
the half carcass of the elephant that lay in the lake, and upon that
they were making their supper. Their plunging in the water could
be distinctly heard from the camp, and during the whole night they
quarrelled and growled, and laughed and yelled, as they gorged
themselves on their ample prey.</p>

<p>Of course Von Bloom and his people did not sit up all night to
listen to this medley of noises. As soon as they perceived that the
brutes were not likely to come any more near the camp, they laid
aside their weapons, returned to their respective sleeping-places, and
were all soon buried in the sweet slumber that follows a day of healthy
exercise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<div class="cap">STALKING THE OUREBI.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">N</span>ext morning the hyenas and jackals had disappeared from the
scene, and, to the surprise of all, not a particle of flesh was left upon
the bones of the elephant. There lay the huge skeleton picked clean,
the bones even polished white by the rough tongues of the hyenas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
Nay, still stranger to relate, two of the horses&mdash;these poor brutes had
been long since left to themselves,&mdash;had been pulled down during the
night, and their skeletons lay at a short distance from the camp as
cleanly picked as that of the elephant!</p>

<p>All this was evidence of the great number of ravenous creatures
that must have their home in that quarter,&mdash;evidence, too, that game
animals abounded, for where these are not numerous the beasts of
prey cannot exist. Indeed, from the quantity of tracks that were
seen upon the shores of the vley, it was evident that animals of
various kinds had drunk there during the night. There was the
round solid hoof of the quagga, and his near congener the dauw; and
there was the neat hoofprint of the gemsbok, and the larger track of
the eland; and among these Von Bloom did not fail to notice the
spoor of the dreaded lion. Although they had not heard his roaring
that night, they had no doubt that there were plenty of his kind in
that part of the country. The presence of his favourite prey,&mdash;the
quaggas, the gemsboks, and the elands,&mdash;were sure indications that
the king of beasts was not far off.</p>

<p>Not much work was done that day. The heavy labour of curing
the biltongue, that had occupied them the whole of the preceding
day, and their disturbed rest, had rendered them all listless; and
neither Von Bloom nor the others had any inclination for work. So
they moved around the camp and did very little.</p>

<p>Swartboy took his elephant's feet from the oven, and cleaned them;
and also let down the biltongue and arranged it so as to be better
exposed to the sun. Von Bloom himself shot the three remaining
horses, having driven them to a good distance from the camp. He
did this to put an end to the suffering of the poor brutes,&mdash;for it was
plain to every one that they could survive but a day or two longer;
and to send a bullet through the heart of each was an act of mercy to
them.</p>

<p>Out of all the live stock of the field-cornet, the cow alone remained,
and she was now tended with the greatest care. Without the precious
milk, which she yielded in such quantity, their diet would have been
savage enough; and they fully appreciated the service she rendered
them. Each day she was driven out to the best pasture, and at night
shut up in a safe kraal of wait-a-bit thorns, that had been built for
her at a little distance from the tree. These thorns had been placed
in such a manner that their shanks all radiated inward, while the
bushy tops were turned out, forming a <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>, that scarce
any animal would have attempted to get through. Such a fence will
turn even the lion, unless when he has been rendered fierce and reckless
by provocation.</p>

<p>Of course a gap had been left for the cow to pass in and out, and
this was closed by one immense bush, which served all the purpose of
a gate. Such was the kraal of &ldquo;old Graaf.&rdquo; Besides the cow, the
only living thing that remained in camp was Tr&uuml;ey's little pet, the
fawn of the gazelle.</p>

<p>But on that very day another pet was added, a dear little creature,
not less beautiful than the springbok, and of still more diminutive
proportions. That was the fawn of an &ldquo;ourebi,&rdquo;&mdash;one of the elegant
little antelopes that are found in such variety over the plains and in
the &ldquo;bush&rdquo; of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>It was to Hendrik they were indebted not only for this pet, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
for a dinner of delicate venison, which they had that day eaten, and
which all of them, except Swartboy, preferred to elephant beef.
Hendrik had procured the venison by a shot from his rifle, and in the
following manner.</p>

<p>About mid-day he went out&mdash;having fancied that upon a large
grassy meadow near the camp he saw some animal. After walking
about half-a-mile, and keeping among bushes, around the edge of the
meadow, he got near enough to be sure that it was an animal he had
observed,&mdash;for he now saw two in the place he had marked.</p>

<p>They were of a kind he had not met with before. They were very
small creatures,&mdash;smaller even than springboks,&mdash;but, from their
general form and appearance, Hendrik knew they were either antelopes
or deer; and, as Hans had told him there were no deer in
Southern Africa, he concluded they must be some species of antelope.
They were a buck and doe,&mdash;this he knew because one of them only
carried horns. The buck was under two feet in height, of slender
make, and pale tawny colour. He was white-bellied, with white
arches above the eyes, and some long white hair under the throat.
Below his knees were yellowish tufts of long hair; and his horns&mdash;instead
of being lyrate, like those of the springbok&mdash;rose nearly
vertical to the height of four inches. They were black in colour,
round-shaped, and slightly ringed. The doe was without horns, and
was a much smaller animal than her mate.</p>

<p>From all these marks Hendrik thought the little antelopes were
&ldquo;ourebis;&rdquo; and such they were.</p>

<p>He continued to stalk in upon them, until he was as close as he
could get. But he was still more than two hundred yards from them,
and of course far from being within shooting distance with his small
rifle.</p>

<p>A thick <i>jong dora</i> bush concealed him, but he dared not go farther
else the game would have taken the alarm. He could perceive that
they were shy creatures.</p>

<p>Every now and again the buck would raise his graceful neck to its
full stretch, utter a slight bleating call, and look suspiciously around
him. From these symptoms Hendrik drew the inference that it was
shy game, and would not be easily approached.</p>

<p>He lay for a moment, thinking what he should do. He was to
leeward of the game, as he had purposely gone there; but after a
while, to his chagrin, he saw that they were feeding up the wind, and
of course widening the distance between them and himself.</p>

<p>It occurred to Hendrik that it might be their habit to browse up
the wind, as springboks and some other species do. If so, he might
as well give it up, or else make a long circuit and head them. To do
this would be a work of labour and of time, and a very uncertain
stalk it would be in the end. After all his long tramping, and creeping,
and crouching, the game would be like enough to scent him
before they came within shot&mdash;for it is for this very reason that their
instinct teaches them to browse against, and not with the wind.</p>

<p>As the plain was large, and the cover very distant, Hendrik was
discouraged and gave up the design he had half formed of trying to
head them.</p>

<p>He was about to rise to his feet, and return home, when it occurred
to him that perhaps he might find a decoy available. He knew there
were several species of antelopes, with whom curiosity was stronger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
than fear. He had often lured the springbok within reach. Why
would not these obey the same impulse?</p>

<p>He determined to make trial. At the worst he could only fail, and
he had no chance of getting a shot otherwise.</p>

<p>Without losing a moment he thrust his hand into his pocket. He
should have found there a large red handkerchief, which he had more
than once used for a similar purpose. To his chagrin it was not there!</p>

<p>He dived into both pockets of his jacket, then into his wide trousers,
then under the breast of his waistcoat. No. The handkerchief was
not to be found. Alas! it had been left in the wagon! It was very
annoying.</p>

<p>What else could he make use of? Take off his jacket and hold it
up? It was not gay enough in colour. It would not do.</p>

<p>Should he raise his hat upon the end of his gun? That might be
better, but still it would look too much like the human form, and
Hendrik knew that all animals feared that.</p>

<p>A happy thought at length occurred to him. He had heard, that
with the curious antelopes, strange forms or movements attract almost
as much as glaring colours. He remembered a trick that was said to
be practised with success by the hunters. It was easy enough, and
consisted merely in the hunter standing upon his hands and head, and
kicking his heels in the air!</p>

<p>Now Hendrik happened to be one of those very boys who had often
practised this little bit of gymnastics for amusement and he could
stand upon his head like an acrobat.</p>

<p>Without losing a moment he placed his rifle upon the ground, between
his hands, and hoisting his feet into the air, commenced kicking them
about, clinking them together, and crossing them in the most fantastic
manner.</p>

<p>He had placed himself so that his face was turned towards the
animals, while he stood upon his head. Of course he could not see
them while in this position, as the grass was a foot high; but, at
intervals, he permitted his feet to descend to the earth; and then, by
looking between his legs, he could tell how the ruse was succeeding.</p>

<p>It did succeed. The buck, on first perceiving the strange object,
uttered a sharp whistle, and darted off with the swiftness of a bird&mdash;for
the &ldquo;ourebi&rdquo; is one of the swiftest of African antelopes. The doe
followed, though not so fast, and soon fell into the rear.</p>

<p>The buck, perceiving this, suddenly halted&mdash;as if ashamed of his
want of gallantry&mdash;wheeled round, and galloped back, until he was
once more between the doe and the odd thing that had alarmed him.</p>

<p>What could this odd thing be? he now seemed to inquire of himself.
It was not a lion, nor a leopard, nor a hyena, nor yet a jackal.
It was neither fox, nor fennec, nor earth-wolf, nor wild hound, nor
any of his well-known enemies. It was not a Bushman neither, for
they are not double-headed as it appeared. What could it be? It
had kept its place&mdash;it had not pursued him. Perhaps it was not at
all dangerous. No doubt it was harmless enough.</p>

<p>So reasoned the ourebi. His curiosity overcame his fear. He would
go a little nearer. He would have a better view of the thing before
he took to flight. No matter what it was, it could do no hurt at that
distance; and as to overtaking him, pah! there wasn't a creature,
biped or quadruped in all Africa that he could not fling dust in the
face of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span></p>

<p>So he went a little nearer, and then a little nearer still, and continued
to advance by successive runs, now this way and now that way,
zigzagging over the plain, until he was within less than a hundred
paces of the odd object that at first sight had so terrified him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/illus-386.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="HENDRIK DECOYING THE OUREBIS." title="HENDRIK DECOYING THE OUREBIS." />
<span class="caption">HENDRIK DECOYING THE OUREBIS.</span></div>

<p>His companion, the doe, kept close after him; and seemed quite as
curious as himself&mdash;her large shining eyes opened to their full extent,
as she stopped to gaze at intervals.</p>

<p>Sometimes the two met each other in their course; and halted a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
moment, as though they held consultation in whispers; and asked
each other if they had yet made out the character of the stranger.</p>

<p>It was evident, however, that neither had done so&mdash;as they still
continued to approach it with looks and gestures of inquiry and
wonder.</p>

<p>At length the odd object disappeared for a moment under the grass;
and then reappeared&mdash;but this time in an altered form. Something
about it glanced brightly under the sun, and this glancing quite
fascinated the buck, so that he could not stir from the spot, but stood
eyeing it steadily.</p>

<p>Fatal fascination! It was his last gaze. A bright flash shot up&mdash;something
struck him through the heart, and he saw the shining
object no more!</p>

<p>The doe bounded forward to where her mate had fallen, and stood
bleating over him. She knew not the cause of his sudden death, but
she saw that he was dead. The wound in his side&mdash;the stream of red
blood&mdash;were under her eyes. She had never witnessed death in that
form before, but she knew her lover was dead. His silence&mdash;his form
stretched along the grass motionless and limber&mdash;his glassy eyes&mdash;all
told her he had ceased to live.</p>

<p>She would have fled, but she could not leave him&mdash;she could not
bear to part even from his lifeless form. She would remain a while,
and mourn over him.</p>

<p>Her widowhood was a short one. Again flashed the priming,&mdash;again
cracked the shining tube&mdash;and the sorrowing doe fell over upon
the body of her mate.</p>

<p>The young hunter rose to his feet, and ran forward. He did not,
according to usual custom, stop to load before approaching his quarry.
The plain was perfectly level, and he saw no other animal upon it.
What was his surprise on reaching the antelopes, to perceive that there
was a third one of the party still alive!</p>

<p>Yes, a little fawn, not taller than a rabbit, was bounding about
through the grass, running around the prostrate body of its mother,
and uttering its tiny bleat.</p>

<p>Hendrik was surprised, because he had not observed this creature
before; but, indeed, he had not seen much of the antelopes until the
moment of taking aim, and the grass had concealed the tiny young
one.</p>

<p>Hunter as Hendrik was, he could not help feeling strongly as he
regarded the <i>tableau</i> before him. But he felt that he had not
wantonly destroyed these creatures for mere amusement, and that
satisfied his conscience.</p>

<p>The little fawn would make a famous pet for Jan, who had often
wished for one, to be equal with his sister. It could be fed upon the
cow's milk, and, though it had lost both father and mother, Hendrik
resolved that it should be carefully brought up. He had no difficulty
in capturing it, as it refused to leave the spot where its mother lay,
and Hendrik soon held the gentle creature in his arms.</p>

<p>He then tied the buck and doe together; and, having fastened
a strong cord round the horns of the latter, he set off dragging the
two antelopes behind him.</p>

<p>As these lay upon the ground, heads foremost, they were drawn
with the grain of the hair, which made it much easier; and as there
was nothing but grass sward to be passed over, the young hunter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
succeeded in taking the whole of his game to camp without any
great difficulty.</p>

<p>The joy of all was great, at seeing such a fine lot of venison, but
Jan's rejoicing was greater than all; and he no longer envied Tr&uuml;ey
the possession of her little gazelle.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">LITTLE JAN'S ADVENTURE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span>t would have been better that Jan had never seen the little
&ldquo;ourebi,&rdquo;&mdash;better both for Jan and the antelope, for that night the
innocent creature was the cause of a terrible panic in the camp.</p>

<p>They had all gone to sleep as on the previous night,&mdash;Von Bloom
and the four children in the wagon, while the Bushman and Totty
slept upon the grass. The latter lay under the wagon; but Swartboy
had kindled a large fire a little distance from it, and beside this had
stretched himself, rolled up in his sheep-skin kaross.</p>

<p>They had all gone to sleep without being disturbed by the hyenas.
This was easily accounted for. The three horses that had been shot
that day occupied the attention of these gentry, for their hideous
voices could be heard off in the direction where the carcasses lay.
Having enough to give them a supper, they found no occasion to
risk themselves in the neighbourhood of the camp, where they had
experienced such a hostile reception on the previous night. So
reasoned Von Bloom, as he turned over and fell asleep.</p>

<p>He did not reason correctly, however. It was true that the
hyenas were just then making a meal upon the horses; but it was
a mistake to suppose that that would satisfy these ravenous brutes,
who never seem to have enough. Long before morning, had Von
Bloom been awake he would have heard the maniac laugh closer to
the camp, and might have seen the green eyes of the hyena glancing
under the expiring blaze of Swartboy's camp-fire.</p>

<p>Indeed, he had heard the beasts once that he awoke; but, knowing
that the biltongue had been this night placed out of their reach, and
thinking that there was nothing to which they could do any harm,
he gave no heed to their noisy demonstrations, and went to sleep
again.</p>

<p>He was awakened, however, by a shrill squeak, as of some animal
in the agonies of death; and then there was a second squeak, that
seemed to be suddenly interrupted by the stifling of the creature's
utterance!</p>

<p>In these cries Von Bloom, as well as the others&mdash;who were now
also awake&mdash;recognised the bleat of the ourebi, for they had heard it
several times during the afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hyenas are killing it!&rdquo; thought they. But they had not
time to say so, before another and far different cry reached their
ears, and caused them all to start as if a bomb-shell had burst under
the wagon. That cry was the voice of Jan, and sounded in the
same direction whence came the scream of the stifled antelope!</p>

<p>&ldquo;O heaven! what could it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child's voice first reached them in a sudden screech&mdash;then
there was a confused noise resembling a scuffle&mdash;and Jan was again
heard crying aloud for help, while at the same time his voice was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
interrupted, and each call appeared to come from a greater distance!
Something or somebody was carrying him off!</p>

<p>This idea occurred to Von Bloom, Hans, and Hendrik, at the same
instant. Of course it filled them with consternation; and, as they
were scarce yet awake, they knew not what to do.</p>

<p>The cries of Jan, however, soon brought them to their senses;
and to run towards the direction whence these came was the first
thought of all.</p>

<p>To grope for their guns would waste time, and all three leaped out
of the wagon without them.</p>

<p>Totty was upon her feet and jabbering, but she knew no more
than they what had happened.</p>

<p>They did not stop long to question her. The voice of Swartboy,
uttered in loud barks and clicks, summoned them elsewhere; and
they now beheld a red flaming brand rushing through the darkness,
which no doubt was carried in the hands of that worthy.</p>

<p>They started off in the direction of the blazing torch, and ran as
fast as they could. They still heard the Bushman's voice, and to
their dismay beyond it the screams of little Jan.</p>

<p>Of course they could not tell what was causing all this. They
only pressed on with fearful apprehensions.</p>

<p>When they had got within some fifty paces of the torch, they
perceived it suddenly descend, then raised again, and brought down,
in a rapid and violent manner! They could hear the voice of the
Bushman barking and clicking louder than ever, as though he was
engaged in chastising some creature.</p>

<p>But Jan's voice they no longer heard&mdash;he was screaming no more&mdash;was
he dead?</p>

<p>With terrible forebodings they rushed on.</p>

<p>When they arrived upon the spot, a singular picture presented
itself to their eyes. Jan lay upon the ground, close in by the roots
of some bushes which he was holding tightly in his grasp. From one
of his wrists extended a stout thong, or <i>rheim</i>, which passed through
among the bushes to the distance of several feet; and, fast to its
other end, was the ourebi fawn, dead, and terribly mangled! Over
the spot stood Swartboy with his burning tree, which blazed all the
brighter that he had just been using it over the back of a ravenous
hyena. The latter was not in sight. It had long since skulked off,
but no one thought of pursuit, as all were too anxious about Jan.</p>

<p>No time was lost in lifting the child to his feet. The eyes of all
ran eagerly over him to see where he was wounded; and an exclamation
of joy soon broke forth when they saw that, except the
scratches of the thorns, and the deep track of a cord upon his wrist,
nothing in the shape of a wound could be discovered upon his
diminutive body. He had now come to himself, and assured them
all that he was not hurt a bit. Hurrah! Jan was safe!</p>

<p>It now fell to Jan's lot to explain all this mysterious business.</p>

<p>He had been lying in the wagon along with the rest, but not like
them asleep. No. He could not sleep a wink for thinking on his
new pet, which, for want of room in the wagon, had been left below
tied to one of the wheels.</p>

<p>Jan had taken it into his head that he would like to have another
look at the ourebi before going to sleep. So, without saying a word
to any one, he crept out of the cap-tent, and descended to where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
antelope was tied. He unloosed it gently, and then led it forward
to the light of the fire, where he sat down to admire the creature.</p>

<p>After gazing upon it for some time with delight, he thought that
Swartboy could not do otherwise than share his feelings; and
without more ado, he shook the Bushman awake.</p>

<p>The latter had no great stomach for being roused out of sleep to
look at an animal, hundreds of which he had eaten in his time. But
Jan and Swartboy were sworn friends, and the Bushman was not
angry. He, therefore, indulged his young master in the fancy he
had taken; and the two sat for a while conversing about the pet.</p>

<p>At length Swartboy proposed sleep. Jan would agree to this only
upon the terms that Swartboy would allow him to sleep alongside of
him. He would bring his blanket from the wagon, and would not
trouble Swartboy by requiring part of the latter's kaross.</p>

<p>Swartboy objected at first; but Jan urged that he had felt cold in
the wagon, and that was partly why he had come down to the fire.
All this was sheer cunning in the little imp. But Swartboy could
not refuse him anything, and at length consented. He could see no
harm in it, as there were no signs of rain.</p>

<p>Jan then returned to the wagon, climbed noiselessly up, drew out
his own blankets, and brought them to the fire. He then wrapped
himself up, and lay down alongside of Swartboy, with the ourebi
standing near, and in such a situation that he could still have his
eyes upon it, even when lying. To secure it from wandering, he had
fastened a strong rheim around its neck, the other end of which he
had looped tightly upon his own wrist.</p>

<p>He lay for some time contemplating his beautiful pet. But sleep
at length overcame him, and the image of the ourebi melted before
his eyes.</p>

<p>Beyond this Jan could tell little of what happened to him. He
was awakened by a sudden jerking at his wrist, and hearing the
antelope scream. But he had not quite opened his eyes, before he
felt himself dragged violently over the ground.</p>

<p>He thought at first it was Swartboy playing some trick upon him;
but as he passed the fire, he saw by its light that it was a huge black
animal that had seized the ourebi, and was dragging both him and it
along.</p>

<p>Of course he then began to scream for help, and caught at everything
he could to keep himself from being carried away. But he
could lay hold of nothing, until he found himself among thick bushes,
and these he seized and held with all his might.</p>

<p>He could not have held out long against the strength of the hyena;
but it was just at that moment that Swartboy came up with his fire-brand,
and beat off the ravisher with a shower of blows.</p>

<p>When they got back to the light of the fire they found that Jan
was all right. But the poor ourebi&mdash;it had been sadly mauled, and
was now of no more value than a dead rat.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<div class="cap">A HOUSE AMONG THE TREE-TOPS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">V</span>on Bloom now reflected that the hyenas were likely to prove a
great pest to him. No meat, nor anything, would be safe from them&mdash;even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
his very children would be in danger, if left alone in the camp;
and no doubt he would often be compelled to leave them, as he would
require the older ones upon his hunting excursions.</p>

<p>There were other animals to be dreaded still more than the hyenas.
Even during that night they had heard the roaring of lions down by
the vley; and when it was morning, the spoor showed that several
of these animals had drunk at the water.</p>

<p>How could he leave little Tr&uuml;ey&mdash;his dear little Tr&uuml;ey&mdash;or Jan,
who was not a bit bigger&mdash;how could he leave them in an open camp
while such monsters were roving about? He could not think of
doing so.</p>

<p>He reflected what course he should pursue. At first he thought of
putting up a house. That would necessarily be a work of time.
There was no good building material convenient. A stone house
would cost a great deal of labour&mdash;as the stones would have to be
carried nearly a mile, and in their hands too. That would never do,
as Von Bloom might only remain a short while at that place. He
might not find many elephants there, and of course would be under
the necessity of going elsewhere.</p>

<p>Why not build a log-house? you will say. That would not be so
much of a job, as part of the country was well wooded, and they had
an axe.</p>

<p>True, part of the country was wooded, but in a particular manner.
With the exception of the nwana-trees, that stood at long distances
apart&mdash;and regularly, as if they had been planted&mdash;there was nothing
that deserved the name of timber. All the rest was mere &ldquo;bush,&rdquo;&mdash;a
thorny jungle of mimosas, euphorbias, arborescent aloes, strelitzias,
and the horrid zamia plants, beautiful enough to the eye, but of no
utility whatever in the building of a house. The nwanas, of course,
were too large for house-logs. To have felled one of them would have
been a task equal almost to the building of a house; and to have
made planks of them would have required a steam saw-mill. A log-house
was not to be thought of either.</p>

<p>Now a frail structure of poles and thatch would not have given
sufficient security. An angry rhinoceros, or elephant, would level
such a house to the ground in a few moments.</p>

<p>Suppose, too, that there were man-eaters in the neighbourhood.
Swartboy believed that there were, and that that region was notorious
for them. As it was not far from Swartboy's native country,
Von Bloom, who had reason to believe what the Bushman told him,
was inclined to credit this. What protection would a frail house
afford against the man-eater? Not much, indeed.</p>

<p>Von Bloom was puzzled and perplexed. He could not commence
his hunting excursions until this question was settled. Some place
must be prepared, where the children would be safe during his
absence.</p>

<p>While revolving the subject in his mind, he happened to cast his
eyes upward among the branches of the nwana-tree. All at once
his attention became fixed upon those huge limbs, for they had
awakened within him a strange memory. He remembered having
heard that, in some parts of the country, and perhaps not very far
from where he then was, the natives live in trees. That sometimes a
whole tribe, of fifty or more, make their home in a single tree; and
do so to secure themselves against savage beasts, and sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
equally savage men. That they build their houses upon platforms,
which they erect upon the horizontal branches; and that they ascend
by means of ladders, which are drawn up after them at night
when they go to rest.</p>

<p>All this Von Bloom had heard, and all of it is positively true. Of
course the reflection occurred to him, why could he not do the same?
Why could he not build a house in the gigantic nwana? That would
give him all the security he desired. There they could all sleep with
perfect confidence of safety. There, on going out to hunt, he could
leave the children, with the certainty of finding them on his return.
An admirable idea!&mdash;how about its practicability?</p>

<p>He began to consider this. If he only had planks to make a staging
or platform, the rest would be easy. Any slight roof would be
sufficient up there. The leaves almost formed a roof. But the
flooring&mdash;this was the difficulty. Where were planks to be got?
Nowhere, in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>His eye, at that moment, chanced to fall upon the wagon. Ha!
there were planks there. But to break up his beautiful wagon?
No&mdash;no&mdash;no! Such a thing was not to be thought of. But stay!
there was no need to break it up&mdash;no need to knock out a single
nail. It would serve every purpose without breaking a splinter off
it. The fine vehicle was made to take to pieces, and put up again
at will.</p>

<p>He could take it to pieces. The broad bottom alone should remain
whole. That of itself would be the platform. Hurrah!</p>

<p>The field-cornet, excited with the development of this fine plan,
now communicated it to the others. All agreed that it was just the
thing; and as the day was before them, they made no more ado, but
set about carrying out the design.</p>

<p>A ladder thirty feet long had first to be constructed. This occupied
a good while; but at length a stout rough article was knocked up,
which served the purpose admirably. It gave them access to the
lowermost limb; and from this they could construct steps to all the
others.</p>

<p>Von Bloom ascended, and after careful examination chose the site
of the platform. This was to rest upon two strong horizontal limbs
of equal height, and diverging very gradually from each other. The
quantity of thick branches in the great tree afforded him a choice.</p>

<p>The wagon was now taken to pieces&mdash;a work of only a few minutes&mdash;and
the first thing hauled up was the bottom. This was no slight
performance, and required all the strength of the camp. Strong
&ldquo;rheims&rdquo; were attached to one end, and these were passed over a
limb of the tree, still higher up than those on which the staging was
to rest. One stood above to guide the huge piece of plankwork,
while all the rest exerted their strength upon the ropes below. Even
little Jan pulled with all his might&mdash;though a single pound avoirdupois
weight would have been about the measure of his strength.</p>

<p>The piece was hoisted up, until it rested beautifully upon the supporting
limbs; and then a cheer rose from below, and was answered
by Swartboy among the branches.</p>

<p>The heaviest part of the work was over. The boxing of the wagon
was passed up, piece by piece, and set in its place just as before.
Some branches were lopped off to make room for the cap-tent; and
then it was also hauled up, and mounted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span></p>

<p>By the time the sun set, everything was in its place; and the a&euml;rial
house was ready for sleeping in. In fact, that very night they slept
in it, or, as Hans jocularly termed it, they all went to &ldquo;roost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they did not consider their new habitation quite complete as
yet. Next day they continued to labour upon it. By means of long
poles they extended their platform from the wagon quite up to the
trunk of the tree, so as to give them a broad terrace to move about
upon.</p>

<p>The poles were fast wattled together by rods of the beautiful
weeping-willow (<i>Salix Babylonica</i>), which is a native of these parts,
and several trees of which grew by the side of the vley. Upon the
top of all, they laid a thick coating of clay, obtained from the edge of
the lake; so that, if need be, they could actually kindle a fire, and
cook their suppers in the tree.</p>

<p>To make a still finer flooring, they procured a quantity of the
material of which the ant-hills are composed; which, being of a
glutinous nature, makes a mortar almost as binding as Roman
cement.</p>

<p>After the main building had been finished off, Swartboy erected a
platform for himself, and one for Totty in another part of the ample
nwana. Above each of these platforms he had constructed a roof or
screen, to shelter their occupants from rain or dew.</p>

<p>There was something odd in the appearance of these two screens,
each of which was about the size of an ordinary umbrella. Their
oddity consisted in the fact that they were ears of the elephant!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE BATTLE OF THE WILD PEACOCKS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>here was no longer anything to hinder the field-cornet from commencing
the real business of his new life, viz., the hunting of the
elephant. He resolved, therefore, to begin at once; for until he should
succeed in &ldquo;bagging&rdquo; a few of these giant animals, he was not easy
in his mind. He might not be able to kill a single one; and then
what would become of all his grand hopes and calculations? They
would end in disappointment, and he should find himself in as bad a
condition as ever.</p>

<p>Indeed worse: for to fail in any undertaking is not only to lose
time, but energy of mind. Success begets genius, courage, and self-reliance&mdash;all
of which contribute to new successes; while failure
intimidates and leads to despair. In a psychological point of view it
is a dangerous thing to fail in any undertaking; and, therefore, before
undertaking anything, one should be well assured of its being possible
and practicable.</p>

<p>Now Von Bloom was not sure that the great design he had formed
was practicable. But in this case, he had no choice. No other means
of livelihood was open to him just then; and he had resolved to make
trial of this. He had faith in his calculations, and he had also good
reason to hope he would succeed; but the thing was yet untried. No
wonder he was in haste to begin the business&mdash;in haste to know what
were his chances of success.</p>

<p>By early day, therefore, he was up and out. Hendrik and Swartboy
only accompanied him, for he could not yet bring himself to leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
the children with no other protection than Totty&mdash;almost as much a
child as themselves. Hans, therefore, remained by the camp.</p>

<p>At first the hunters followed the little rivulet that ran from the
spring and vley. They did so, because in this direction there was
more &ldquo;bush;&rdquo; and they knew that elephants would be more likely to
be found in woods than in open places. Indeed, it was only near the
banks of the stream that any great quantity of wood was to be seen.
A broad belt of jungle extended upon each side of it. After that,
there were straggling groves and clumps; and then came the open
plains, almost treeless, though covered with a rich carpet of grass for
some distance farther. To this succeeded the wild karoo, stretching
eastward and westward beyond the reach of vision. Along the north,
as already mentioned, trended the line of &ldquo;bluffs&rdquo;; and beyond these
there was nothing but the parched and waterless desert. To the
south there lay the only thing that could be called &ldquo;woods;&rdquo; and
although such a low jungle could lay no claim to the title of &ldquo;forest,&rdquo;
it was, nevertheless, a likely enough haunt for elephants.</p>

<p>The trees consisted chiefly of mimosas&mdash;of several species, upon
the leaves, roots, and tender shoots of which the great ruminant loves
to browse. There were some &ldquo;cameel-doorn&rdquo; trees, with their shady
umbrella-like tops. But above all rose the massive heads of the
nwanas, giving a peculiar character to the landscape.</p>

<p>The hunters noticed, as they went on, that the channel of the
rivulet became wider and larger, and that at times&mdash;no doubt after
great rains&mdash;a large quantity of water must have run in its bed,
forming a considerable river. But as the channel grew larger, the
reverse was the case with the quantity of running water. The farther
down they proceeded this became less and less; until, at the distance
of a mile from camp, the current ceased altogether.</p>

<p>For half-a-mile farther on they found water in stagnant pools, but
none running. The wide, dry channel, however, continued on as
before; and the &ldquo;bush&rdquo; extended on both sides without interruption, so
thick that they could only make way by keeping in the channel itself.</p>

<p>As they walked along, several kinds of small game were started.
Hendrik would gladly have taken a shot at some of these, but his
father would not permit him to fire just then. It might frighten
away the great &ldquo;game&rdquo; they were in search of, and which they might
fall in with at any moment. On their return Hendrik might do his
best; and then the field-cornet intended to assist him in procuring
an antelope, as there was no fresh venison in the camp. This, however,
was a consideration of secondary importance, and the first thing
to be done was to try and get a pair of tusks.</p>

<p>There was no objection to Swartboy using his bow, as that silent
weapon would cause no alarm. Swartboy had been taken along to
carry the axe and other implements as well as to assist in the hunt.
Of course he had brought his bow and quiver with him; and he was
constantly on the watch for something at which to let fly one of his
little poisoned arrows.</p>

<p>He found a mark at length worthy of his attention. On crossing
the plain to avoid a large bend in the channel, they came upon a
glade or opening of considerable size, and in the middle of this glade
a huge bird appeared standing erect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ostrich!&rdquo; exclaimed Hendrik.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Swartboy; &ldquo;um ar da pauw.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Von Bloom, confirming Swartboy's statement, &ldquo;it is the
pauw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now a &ldquo;pauw&rdquo; in the Dutch language is a &ldquo;peacock.&rdquo; But there
are no peacocks in Africa. The peacock in its wild state inhabits
only Southern Asia and the islands of the Indian Archipelago. The
bird they saw, then, could not be a peacock.</p>

<p>Neither was it one. And yet it bore some resemblance to a peacock,
with its long heavy tail and wings speckled and ocellated in a very
striking manner, and something like the &ldquo;marbled&rdquo; feathers that
adorn the peacock's back. It had none of the brilliant colours,
however, of that proudest of birds, though it was quite as stately,
and much larger and taller. In fact, its great height and erect
attitude was why Hendrik at first glance had taken it for an ostrich.
It was neither peacock nor ostrich, but belonging to a different genus
from either&mdash;to the genus <i>Otis</i> or bustard. It was the great bustard
of South Africa&mdash;the <i>Otis kori</i>&mdash;called &ldquo;pauw&rdquo; by the Dutch colonists,
on account of its ocellated plumage and other points of resemblance
to the Indian peacock.</p>

<p>Now Swartboy, as well as Von Bloom, knew that the pauw was one
of the most delicious of fowls for the table. But they knew at the
same time that it was one of the shyest of birds,&mdash;so shy that it is
very difficult to get even a long shot at one. How, then, was it to be
approached within range of the Bushman's arrow? That was the
point to be considered.</p>

<p>Where it stood, it was full two hundred yards from them; and had
it perceived them, it would soon have widened that distance, by
running off two hundred more. I say running off, for birds of the
bustard family rarely take to wing, but use their long legs to escape
from an enemy. On this account they are often hunted by dogs, and
caught after a severe chase. Although but poor flyers, they are
splendid runners,&mdash;swift almost as the ostrich itself.</p>

<p>The pauw, however, had not observed the hunters as yet. They had
caught a glimpse of it, before appearing out of the bushes, and had
halted as soon as they saw it.</p>

<p>How was Swartboy to approach it? It was two hundred yards
from any cover, and the ground was as clean as a new-raked meadow.
True, the plain was not a large one. Indeed, Swartboy was rather
surprised to see a pauw upon so small a one, for these birds frequent
only the wide open karoos, where they can sight their enemy at a
great distance. The glade was not large, but, after watching the
bustard for some minutes, the hunters saw that it was resolved to
keep near the centre, and showed no disposition to feed in the direction
of the thicket on either side.</p>

<p>Any one but a Bushman would have despaired of getting a shot at
this kori; but Swartboy did not despair.</p>

<p>Begging the others to remain quiet, he crept forward to the edge of
the jungle, and placed himself behind a thick leafy bush. He then
commenced uttering a call, exactly similar to that made by the male
of the kori when challenging an adversary to combat.</p>

<p>Like the grouse, the bustard is polygamous, and of course terribly
jealous and pugnacious, at certain seasons of the year. Swartboy
knew that it was just then the &ldquo;fighting season&rdquo; among the pauws,
and hoped by imitating their challenge to draw the bird&mdash;a cock he
saw it was&mdash;within reach of his arrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the kori heard the call, he raised himself to his full height,
spread his immense tail, dropped his wings until the primary feathers
trailed along the grass, and replied to the challenge.</p>

<p>But what now astonished Swartboy was, that instead of one answer
to his call, he fancied he heard two, simultaneously uttered!</p>

<p>It proved to be no fancy, for before he could repeat the decoy the bird
again gave out its note of defiance, and was answered by a similar
call from another quarter!</p>

<p>Swartboy looked in the direction whence came the latter; and there
sure enough, was a second kori, that seemed to have dropped from the
region of the clouds, or, more likely, had run out from the shelter of
the bushes. At all events, it was a good way towards the centre of
the plain, before the hunter had observed it.</p>

<p>The two were now in full view of each other; and by their movements
any one might see that a combat was certain to come off.</p>

<p>Sure of this, Swartboy did not call again; but remained silent
behind his bush.</p>

<p>After a good while spent in strutting, and wheeling round and
round, and putting themselves in the most threatening attitudes, and
uttering the most insulting expressions, the two koris became sufficiently
provoked to begin the battle. They &ldquo;clinched&rdquo; in gallant
style, using all three weapons,&mdash;wings, beak, and feet. Now they
struck each other with their wings, now pecked with their bills; and
at intervals, when a good opportunity offered, gave each other a smart
kick&mdash;which, with their long muscular legs, they were enabled to
deliver with considerable force.</p>

<p>Swartboy knew that when they were well into the fight, he might
stalk in upon them unobserved; so he waited patiently, till the proper
moment should arrive.</p>

<p>In a few seconds it became evident, he would not have to move from
his ambush; for the birds were fighting towards him. He adjusted
his arrow to the string, and waited.</p>

<p>In five minutes the birds were fighting within thirty yards of the
spot where the Bushman lay. The twang of a bowstring might have
been heard by one of the koris, had he been listening. The other
could not possibly have heard it; for before the sound could have
reached him, a poisoned arrow was sticking through his ears. The
barb had passed through, and the shaft remained in his head, piercing
it crosswise!</p>

<p>Of course the bird dropped dead upon the grass, less astonished than
his antagonist.</p>

<p>The latter at first imagined he had done it, and began to strut very
triumphantly around his fallen foe.</p>

<p>But his eye now fell upon the arrow sticking through the head of
the latter. He knew nothing about that. He had not done that!
What the deuce&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Perhaps if he had been allowed another moment's reflection, he
would have taken to his heels; but before he could make up his mind
about the matter, there was another &ldquo;twang&rdquo; of the bowstring
another arrow whistled through the air, and another kori lay stretched
upon the grass!</p>

<p>Swartboy now rushed forward, and took possession of the game;
which proved to be a pair of young cocks, in prime condition for roasting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span></p>

<p>Having hung the birds over a high branch, so as to secure them from
jackals and hyenas, the hunters continued on; and shortly after,
having re-entered the channel of the stream, continued to follow it
downward.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<div class="cap">UPON THE SPOOR.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>hey had not gone above an hundred yards farther, when they came
to one of the pools, already spoken of. It was a tolerably large one;
and the mud around its edges bore the hoof-prints of numerous
animals. This the hunters saw from a distance, but on reaching the
spot, Swartboy, a little in the advance, turned suddenly round, and,
with rolling orbs and quivering lips, clicked out the words,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mein baas! mein baas! da klow! spoor ob da groot olifant!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no danger of mistaking the spoor of the elephant for that
of any other creature. There, sure enough, were the great round
tracks&mdash;full twenty-four inches in length, and nearly as wide&mdash;deeply
imprinted in the mud by the enormous weight of the animal's body.
Each formed an immense hole, large enough to have set a gate-post
in.</p>

<p>The hunters contemplated the spoor with emotions of pleasure&mdash;the
more so that the tracks had been recently made. This was evident.
The displaced mud had not yet crusted, but looked damp and fresh.
It had been stirred within the hour.</p>

<p>Only one elephant had visited the pool that night. There were
many old tracks, but only one fresh spoor,&mdash;and that of an old and
very large bull.</p>

<p>Of course the tracks told this much. To make a spoor twenty-four
inches long, requires the animal to be a very large one; and to be very
large, he should be a bull, and an old one too.</p>

<p>Well, the older and larger the better, provided his tusks have not
been broken by some accident. When that happens they are never
recovered again. The elephant does cast his tusks, but only in the
juvenile state, when they are not bigger than lobster's claws; and
the pair that succeeds these is permanent, and has to last him for
life&mdash;perhaps for centuries&mdash;for no one can tell how long the mighty
elephant roams over this sublunary planet.</p>

<p>When the tusks get broken&mdash;a not uncommon thing&mdash;he must
remain toothless or &ldquo;tuskless&rdquo; for the rest of his life. Although the
elephant may consider the loss of his huge tusks a great calamity,
were he only a little wiser, he would break them off against the first
tree. It would, in all probability, be the means of prolonging his life;
for the hunter would not then consider him worth the ammunition it
usually takes to kill him.</p>

<p>After a short consultation among the hunters, Swartboy started off
upon the spoor, followed by Von Bloom and Hendrik. It led straight
out from the channel, and across the jungle.</p>

<p>Usually the bushes mark the course of an elephant, where these are
of the sort he feeds upon. In this case he had not fed; but the Bushman,
who could follow spoor with a hound, had no difficulty in keeping
on the track, as fast as the three were able to travel.</p>

<p>They emerged into open glades; and, after passing through several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
of these, came upon a large ant-hill that stood in the middle of one of
the openings. The elephant had passed close to the ant-hill&mdash;he had
stopped there awhile&mdash;stay, he must have lain down.</p>

<p>Von Bloom did not know that elephants were in the habit of
lying down. He had always heard it said that they slept standing.
Swartboy knew better than that. He said that they sometimes
slept standing, but oftener lay down, especially in districts where
they were not much hunted. Swartboy considered it a good sign
that this one had lain down. He reasoned from it that the
elephants had not been disturbed in that neighbourhood, and would
be the more easily approached and killed. They would be less
likely to make off from that part of the country, until they&mdash;the
hunters&mdash;had had a &ldquo;good pull&rdquo; out of them.</p>

<p>This last consideration was one of great importance. In a district
where elephants have been much hunted, and have learnt what the
crack of a gun signifies, a single day's chase will often set them
travelling; and they will not bring up again, until they have gone
far beyond the reach of the hunters. Not only the particular individuals
that have been chased act in this way; but all the others,&mdash;as
though warned by their companions,&mdash;until not an elephant remains
in the district. This migratory habit is one of the chief difficulties
which the elephant-hunter must needs encounter; and, when it
occurs, he has no other resource but to change his &ldquo;sphere of
action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the other hand, where elephants have remained for a long
time undisturbed, the report of a gun does not terrify them; and
they will bear a good deal of hunting before &ldquo;showing their heels&rdquo;
and leaving the place.</p>

<p>Swartboy, therefore, rejoiced on perceiving that the old bull had
lain down. The Bushman drew a world of conclusions from that
circumstance.</p>

<p>That the elephant had been lying was clear enough. The abrasion
upon the stiff mud of the ant-heap showed where his back had rested,&mdash;the
mark of his body was visible in the dust, and a groove-like
furrow in the turf had been made by his huge tusk. A huge one it
must have been, as the impression of it testified to the keen eyes of
the Bushman.</p>

<p>Swartboy stated some curious facts about the great quadruped,&mdash;at
least, what he alleged to be facts. They were,&mdash;that the elephant
never attempts to lie down without having something to lean his
shoulders against,&mdash;a rock, an ant-hill, or a tree; that he does this
to prevent himself rolling over on his back,&mdash;that when he does
by accident get into that position he has great difficulty in rising
again, and is almost as helpless as a turtle; and, lastly, that he often
sleeps standing beside a tree with the whole weight of his body
leaning against the trunk!</p>

<p>Swartboy did not think that he leans against the trunk when first
taking up his position; but that he seeks the tree for the shade
it affords, and as sleep overcomes him he inclines towards it, finding
that it steadies and rests him!</p>

<p>The Bushman stated, moreover, that some elephants have their
favourite trees, to which they return again and again to take a nap
during the hot mid-day hours,&mdash;for that is their time of repose. At
night they do not sleep. On the contrary, the hours of night are spent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
in ranging about, on journeys to the distant watering-places, and in
feeding; though in remote and quiet districts they also feed by day&mdash;so
that it is probable that most of their nocturnal activity is the
result of their dread of their watchful enemy, man.</p>

<p>Swartboy communicated these facts, as the hunters all together
followed upon the spoor.</p>

<p>The traces of the elephant were now of a different character, from
what they had been before arriving at the ant-hill. He had been
browsing as he went. His nap had brought a return of appetite;
and the wait-a-bit thorns showed the marks of his prehensile trunk.
Here and there branches were broken off, stripped clean of their
leaves, and the ligneous parts left upon the ground. In several
places whole trees were torn up by their roots, and those, too, of
considerable size. This the elephant sometimes does to get at their
foliage, which upon such trees grows beyond the reach of his proboscis.
By prostrating them of course he gets their whole frondage
within easy distance of his elastic nose, and can strip it off at
pleasure.</p>

<p>At times, however, he tears up a tree to make a meal of its roots&mdash;as
there are several species with sweet juicy roots, of which the
elephant is extremely fond. These he drags out of the ground with
his trunk, having first loosened them with his tusks, used as crowbars.
At times he fails to effect his purpose; and it is only when the
ground is loose or wet, as after great rains, that he can uproot the
larger kinds of mimosas. Sometimes he is capricious; and, after
drawing a tree from the ground, he carries it many yards along with
him, flings it to the ground, root upwards, and then leaves it, after
taking a single mouthful. Destructive to the forest is the passage
of a troop of elephants!</p>

<p>Small trees he can tear up with his trunk alone, but to the larger
ones he applies the more powerful leverage of his tusks. These he
inserts under the roots, imbedded as they usually are in loose sandy
earth, and then, with a quick jerk, he tosses roots, trunk, and
branches, high into the air,&mdash;a wonderful exhibition of gigantic
power.</p>

<p>The hunters saw all these proofs of it, as they followed the spoor.
The traces of the elephant's strength were visible all along the route.</p>

<p>It was enough to beget fear and awe, and none of them were free
from such feelings. With so much disposition to commit havoc and
ruin in his moments of quietude, what would such a creature be in
the hour of excitement and anger? No wonder there was fear in
the hearts of the hunters, unpractised as some of them were.</p>

<p>Still another consideration had its effect upon their minds,
particularly on that of the Bushman. There was every reason to
believe that the animal was a &ldquo;rover,&rdquo;&mdash;what among Indian hunters
is termed a &ldquo;rogue.&rdquo; Elephants of this kind are far more dangerous
to approach than their fellows. In fact, under ordinary circumstances,
there is no more danger in passing through a herd of
elephants than there would be in going among a drove of tame oxen.
It is only when the elephant has been attacked or wounded, that he
becomes a dangerous enemy.</p>

<p>With regard to the &ldquo;rover&rdquo; or &ldquo;rogue,&rdquo; the case is quite different.
He is habitually vicious; and will assail either man or any other
animal on sight, and without the slightest provocation. He seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
to take a pleasure in destruction, and woe to the creature who
crosses his path and is not of lighter heels than himself!</p>

<p>The rover leads a solitary life, rambling alone through the forest,
and never associating with others of his kind. He appears to be
a sort of outlaw from his tribe, banished for bad temper or some
other fault, to become more fierce and wicked in his outlawry.</p>

<p>There were good reasons for fearing that the elephant they were
spooring was a &ldquo;rover.&rdquo; His being alone was of itself a suspicious
circumstance, as elephants usually go, from two to twenty, or even
fifty, in a herd. The traces of ruin he had left behind him, his
immense spoor, all seemed to mark him out as one of these fierce
creatures. That such existed in that district they already had
evidence. Swartboy alleged that the one killed by the rhinoceros
was of this class, else he would not have attacked the latter as he
had done. There was a good deal of probability in this belief of the
Bushman.</p>

<p>Under these impressions, then, it is less to be wondered, that our
hunters felt some apprehensions of danger from the game they were
pursuing.</p>

<p>The spoor grew fresher and fresher. The hunters saw trees turned
bottom upward, the roots exhibiting the marks of the elephant's
teeth, and still wet with the saliva from his vast mouth. They saw
broken branches of the mimosa giving out their odour, that had not
had time to waste itself. They concluded the game could not be
distant.</p>

<p>They rounded a point of timber&mdash;the Bushman being a little in
the advance.</p>

<p>Suddenly Swartboy stopped and fell back a pace. He turned
his face upon his companions. His eyes rolled faster than ever; but,
although his lips appeared to move, and his tongue to wag, he was
too excited to give utterance to a word. A volley of clicks and hisses
came forth, but nothing articulate.</p>

<p>The others, however, did not require any words to tell them what
was meant. They knew that Swartboy intended to whisper that
he had seen &ldquo;da oliphant;&rdquo; so both peeped silently around the bush,
and with their own eyes looked upon the mighty quadruped.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<div class="cap">A ROGUE ELEPHANT.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he elephant was standing in a grove of <i>mokhala</i> trees. These, unlike
the humbler mimosas, have tall naked stems, with heads of thick
foliage, in form resembling an umbrella or parasol. Their pinnate
leaves of delicate green are the favourite food of the giraffe, hence
their botanical appellation of <i>Acacia giraff&aelig;</i>; and hence also their
common name among the Dutch hunters of &ldquo;cameel-doorns&rdquo; (camel-thorns).</p>

<p>The tall giraffe, with his prehensile lip, raised nearly twenty feet
in the air, can browse upon these trees without difficulty. Not so
the elephant, whose trunk cannot reach so high; and the latter
would often have to imitate the fox in the fable, were he not possessed
of a means whereby he can bring the tempting morsel within
reach&mdash;that is, simply by breaking down the tree. This his vast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
strength enables him to do, unless when the trunk happens to be one
of the largest of its kind.</p>

<p>When the eyes of our hunters first rested upon the elephant, he
was standing by the head of a prostrate mokhala, which he had just
broken off near the root. He was tearing away at the leaves, and
filling his capacious stomach.</p>

<p>As soon as Swartboy recovered the control over his tongue, he
ejaculated in a hurried whisper:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pas op! (take care!) baas Bloom,&mdash;hab good care&mdash;don't go near
um&mdash;he da skellum ole klow. My footy! he wicked!&mdash;I know de ole
bull duyvel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this volley of queer phrases, Swartboy meant to caution his
master against rashly approaching the elephant, as he knew him to
be one of the wicked sort&mdash;in short, a &ldquo;rogue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How Swartboy knew this would appear a mystery, as there were
no particular marks about the animal to distinguish him from others
of his kind. But the Bushman, with his practised eye, saw something
in the general physiognomy of the elephant&mdash;just as one may
distinguish a fierce and dangerous bull from those of milder disposition,
or a bad from a virtuous man, by some expression that one
cannot define.</p>

<p>Von Bloom himself, and even Hendrik, saw that the elephant had
a fierce and ruffian look.</p>

<p>They did not stand in need of Swartboy's advice to act with
caution.</p>

<p>They remained for some minutes, gazing through the bushes at the
huge quadruped. The more they gazed, the more they became resolved
to make an attack upon him. The sight of his long tusks was
too tempting to Von Bloom, to admit for a moment the thought of
letting him escape without a fight. A couple of bullets he should
have into him, at all events; and if opportunity offered, a good many
more, should these not be sufficient. Von Bloom would not relinquish
those fine tusks without a struggle.</p>

<p>He at once set about considering the safest mode of attack; but
was not allowed time to mature any plan. The elephant appeared to
be restless, and was evidently about to move forward. He might be
off in a moment, and carry them after him for miles, or, perhaps, in
the thick cover of wait-a-bits get lost to them altogether.</p>

<p>These conjectures caused Von Bloom to decide at once upon
beginning the attack, and without any other plan than to stalk in as
near as would be safe, and deliver his fire. He had heard that a
single bullet in the forehead would kill any elephant; and if he
could only get in such a position as to have a fair shot at the animal's
front, he believed he was marksman enough to plant his bullet in the
right place.</p>

<p>He was mistaken as to killing an elephant with a shot in the forehead.
That is a notion of gentlemen who have hunted the elephant
in their closets&mdash;though other closet gentlemen&mdash;the anatomists&mdash;to
whom give all due credit&mdash;have shown the thing to be impossible,
from the peculiar structure of the elephant's skull and the position
of his brain.</p>

<p>Von Bloom at the time was under this wrong impression, and
therefore committed a grand mistake. Instead of seeking a side
shot, which he could have obtained with far less trouble&mdash;he decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
on creeping round in front of the elephant, and firing right in the
animal's face.</p>

<p>Leaving Hendrik and Swartboy to attack him from behind, he
took a circuit under cover of the bushes; and at length arrived in
the path the elephant was most likely to take.</p>

<p>He had scarcely gained his position, when he saw the huge animal
coming towards him with silent and majestic tread; and although
the elephant only walked, half-a-dozen of his gigantic strides brought
him close up to the ambushed hunter. As yet the creature uttered
no cry; but as he moved, Von Bloom could hear a rumbling gurgling
sound, as of water dashing to and fro in his capacious stomach!</p>

<p>Von Bloom had taken up his position behind the trunk of a large
tree. The elephant had not yet seen him, and, perhaps, would have
passed on without knowing that he was there, had the hunter permitted
him. The latter even thought of such a thing, for although
a man of courage, the sight of the great forest giant caused him for a
moment to quail.</p>

<p>But, again, the curving ivory gleamed in his eyes&mdash;again he remembered
the object that had brought him into that situation; he
thought of his fallen fortunes&mdash;of his resolve to retrieve them&mdash;of his
children's welfare.</p>

<p>These thoughts resolved him. His long roer was laid over a knot
in the trunk&mdash;its muzzle pointed at the forehead of the advancing
elephant&mdash;his eye gleamed through the sights&mdash;the loud detonation
followed&mdash;and a cloud of smoke for a moment hid everything from
his view.</p>

<p>He could hear a hoarse, bellowing, trumpet-like sound&mdash;he could
hear the crashing of branches and the gurgling of water; and, when,
the smoke cleared away, to his chagrin he saw that the elephant was
still upon his feet, and evidently not injured in the least!</p>

<p>The shot had struck the animal exactly where the hunter had
aimed it; but, instead of inflicting a mortal wound, it had only excited
the creature to extreme rage. He was now charging about
striking the trees with his tusks, tearing branches off, and tossing
them aloft with his trunk&mdash;though all the while evidently in ignorance
of what had tickled him so impertinently upon the forehead!</p>

<p>Fortunately for Von Bloom, a good thick tree sheltered him from
the view of the elephant. Had the enraged animal caught sight of
him at that moment, it would have been all up with him; but the
hunter knew this, and had the coolness to remain close and quiet.</p>

<p>Not so with Swartboy. When the elephant moved forward, he
and Hendrik had crept after through the grove of mokhalas. They
had even followed him across the open ground into the bush, where
Von Bloom awaited him. On hearing the shot, and seeing that the
elephant was still unhurt, Swartboy's courage gave way; and leaving
Hendrik, he ran back towards the mokhala grove, shouting as he
went.</p>

<p>His cries reached the ears of the elephant, that at once rushed off
in the direction in which he heard them. In a moment he emerged
from the bush, and, seeing Swartboy upon the open ground, charged
furiously after the flying Bushman. Hendrik&mdash;who had stood his
ground, and in the shelter of the bushes was not perceived&mdash;delivered
his shot as the animal passed him. His ball told upon the
shoulder, but it only served to increase the elephant's fury. Without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
stopping, he rushed on after Swartboy, believing, no doubt, that the
poor Bushman was the cause of the hurts he was receiving, and the
nature of which he but ill understood.</p>

<p>It was but a few moments, from the firing of the first shot, until
things took this turn. Swartboy was hardly clear of the bushes
before the elephant emerged also; and as the former struck out for
the mokhala trees, he was scarce six steps ahead of his pursuer.</p>

<p>Swartboy's object was to get to the grove, in the midst of which
were several trees of large size. One of these he proposed climbing&mdash;as
that seemed his only chance for safety.</p>

<p>He had not got half over the open ground, when he perceived he
would be too late. He heard the heavy rush of the huge monster behind
him&mdash;he heard his loud and vengeful bellowing&mdash;he fancied he
felt his hot breath. There was still a good distance to be run. The
climbing of the tree, beyond the reach of the elephant's trunk, would
occupy time. There was no hope of escaping to the tree.</p>

<p>These reflections occurred almost instantaneously. In ten seconds
Swartboy arrived at the conclusion, that running to the tree would
not save him; and all at once he stopped in his career, wheeled
round, and faced the elephant!</p>

<p>Not that he had formed any plan of saving himself in that way.
It was not bravery, but only despair, that caused him to turn upon
his pursuer. He knew that, by running on, he would surely be
overtaken. It could be no worse if he faced round; and, perhaps,
he might avoid the fatal charge by some dexterous man&#339;uvre.</p>

<p>The Bushman was now right in the middle of the open ground;
the elephant rushing straight towards him.</p>

<p>The former had no weapon to oppose to his gigantic pursuer. He
had thrown away his bow&mdash;his axe too&mdash;to run the more nimbly.
But neither would have been of any avail against such an antagonist.
He carried nothing but his sheep-skin kaross. That had encumbered
him in his flight; but he had held on to it for a purpose.</p>

<p>His purpose was soon displayed.</p>

<p>He stood until the extended trunk was within three feet of his
face; and then, flinging his kaross so that it should fall over the
long cylinder, he sprang nimbly to one side, and started to run back.</p>

<p>He would, no doubt, have succeeded in passing to the elephant's
rear, and thus have escaped; but as the kaross fell upon the great
trunk it was seized in the latter, and swept suddenly around. Unfortunately
Swartboy's legs had not yet cleared the circle&mdash;the kaross
lapped around them&mdash;and the Bushman was thrown sprawling upon
the plain.</p>

<p>In a moment the active Swartboy recovered his feet, and was
about to make off in a new direction. But the elephant, having
discovered the deception of the kaross, had dropped it, and turned
suddenly after him. Swartboy had hardly made three steps, when
the long ivory curve was inserted between his legs from behind; and
the next moment his body was pitched high into the air.</p>

<p>Von Bloom and Hendrik, who had just then reached the edge
of the glade, saw him go up; but to their astonishment he did not
come to the ground again! Had he fallen back upon the elephant's
tusks? and was he held there by the trunk? No. They saw the
animal's head. The Bushman was not there, nor upon his back, nor
anywhere to be seen. In fact, the elephant seemed as much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
astonished as they at the sudden disappearance of his victim! The
huge beast was turning his eyes in every direction, as if searching
for the object of his fury!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-404.jpg" width="500" height="351" alt="SWARTBOY IN A PREDICAMENT." title="SWARTBOY IN A PREDICAMENT." />
<span class="caption">SWARTBOY IN A PREDICAMENT.</span></div>

<p>Where could Swartboy have gone? Where? At this moment the
elephant gave a loud roar, and was seen rushing to a tree, which
he now caught in his trunk, and shook violently. Von Bloom and
Hendrik looked up towards its top, expecting to see Swartboy there.
Sure enough he was there, perched among the leaves and branches
where he had been projected! Terror was depicted in his countenance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
for he felt that he was not safe in his position. But he had
scarce time to give utterance to his fears; for the next moment
the tree gave way with a crash, and fell to the ground, bringing the
Bushman down among its branches.</p>

<p>It happened that the tree, dragged down by the elephant's trunk,
fell towards the animal. Swartboy even touched the elephant's
body in his descent, and slipped down over his hind-quarters. The
branches had broken the fall, and the Bushman was still unhurt, but
he felt that he was now quite at the mercy of his antagonist. He
saw no chance of escape by flight. He was lost!</p>

<p>Just at that moment an idea entered his mind&mdash;a sort of despairing
instinct&mdash;and springing at one of the hind-legs of the quadruped, he
slung his arms around it, and held fast! He at the same time
planted his naked feet upon the sabots of those of the animal; so
that, by means of this support, he was enabled to keep his hold, let
the animal move as it would!</p>

<p>The huge mammoth, unable to shake him off, unable to get at him
with his trunk&mdash;and, above all, surprised and terrified by this novel
mode of attack&mdash;uttered a shrill scream, and with tail erect and
trunk high in air, dashed off into the jungle!</p>

<p>Swartboy held on to the leg until fairly within the bushes; and
then, watching his opportunity, he slipped gently off. As soon as he
touched <i>terra firma</i> again, he rose to his feet, and ran with all his
might in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>He need not have run a single step; for the elephant, as much
frightened as he, kept on through the jungle, laying waste the trees
and branches in his onward course. The huge quadruped did not
stop, till he had put many miles between himself and the scene of
his disagreeable adventure!</p>

<p>Von Bloom and Hendrik had by this time reloaded, and were
advancing to Swartboy's rescue; but they were met right in the
teeth by the swift-flying Bushman, as he returned from his miraculous
escape.</p>

<p>The hunters, who were now warmed to their work, proposed to
follow up the spoor; but Swartboy, who had enough of that &ldquo;old
rogue,&rdquo; declared that there would be not the slightest chance of
again coming up with him without horses or dogs; and as they had
neither, spooring him any farther would be quite useless.</p>

<p>Von Bloom saw that there was truth in the remark, and now more
than ever did he regret the loss of his horses. The elephant, though
easily overtaken on horseback, or with dogs to bring him to bay, can
as easily escape from a hunter on foot; and once he has made up his
mind to flight, it is quite a lost labour to follow him farther.</p>

<p>It was now too late in the day to seek for other elephants; and
with a feeling of disappointment, the hunters gave up the chase, and
turned their steps in the direction of the camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE MISSING HUNTER, AND THE WILDEBEESTS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">A</span> well-known proverb says that &ldquo;misfortunes seldom come single.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On nearing the camp, the hunters could perceive that all was not
right there. They saw Totty with Tr&uuml;ey and Jan standing by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
head of the ladder; but there was something in their manner that told
that all was not right. Where was Hans?</p>

<p>As soon as the hunters came in sight, Jan and Tr&uuml;ey ran down the
rounds, and out to meet them. There was that in their glances that
bespoke ill tidings, and their words soon confirmed this conjecture.</p>

<p>Hans was not there&mdash;he had gone away hours ago&mdash;they knew not
where, they feared something had happened to him,&mdash;they feared he
was lost!</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what took him away from the camp?&rdquo; asked Von Bloom,
surprised and troubled at the news.</p>

<p>That, and only that could they answer. A number of odd-looking
animals&mdash;very odd-looking, the children said,&mdash;had come to the vley
to drink. Hans had taken his gun and followed them in a great
hurry, telling Tr&uuml;ey and Jan to keep in the tree, and not come down
until he returned. He would be gone only a very little while, and
they needn't fear.</p>

<p>This was all they knew. They could not even tell what direction
he had taken. He went by the lower end of the vley; but soon the bushes
hid him from their view, and they saw no more of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what time was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was many hours ago,&mdash;in the morning in fact,&mdash;not long after
the hunters themselves had started. When he did not return the
children grew uneasy; but they thought he had fallen in with papa
and Hendrik, and was helping them to hunt; and that was the
reason why he stayed so long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had they heard any report of a gun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No&mdash;they had listened for that, but heard none. The animals had
gone away before Hans could get his gun ready; and they supposed
he had to follow some distance, before he could overtake them&mdash;that
might be the reason they had heard no shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of animals were they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had all seen them plain enough, as they drank. They had
never seen any of the kind before. They were large animals of
a yellow-brown colour, with shaggy manes, and long tufts of hair
growing out of their breasts, and hanging down between their fore-legs.
They were as big as ponies, said Jan, and very like ponies.
They curvetted and capered about just as ponies do sometimes.
Tr&uuml;ey thought that they looked more like lions!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lions!&rdquo; ejaculated her father and Hendrik, with an accent that
betokened alarm.</p>

<p>Indeed, they reminded her of lions, Tr&uuml;ey again affirmed, and
Totty said the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many were there of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! a great drove, not less than fifty.&rdquo; They could not have
counted them, as they were constantly in motion, galloping from
place to place, and butting each other with their horns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! they had horns then?&rdquo; interrogated Von Bloom, relieved by
this announcement.</p>

<p>Certainly they had horns, replied all three.</p>

<p>They had seen the horns, sharp-pointed ones, which first came down,
and then turned upwards in front of the animals' faces. They had
manes too, Jan affirmed; and thick necks that curved like that of a
beautiful horse; and tufts of hair like brushes upon their noses; and
nice round bodies like ponies, and long white tails that reached near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
the ground, just like the tails of ponies, and finely-shaped limbs as
ponies have.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; continued Jan, with emphasis, &ldquo;if it hadn't been for
their horns and the brushes of long hair upon their breasts and noses,
I'd have taken them for ponies before anything. They galloped about
just like ponies when playing, and ran with their heads down, curving
their necks and tossing their manes,&mdash;aye, and snorting too, as I've
heard ponies; but sometimes they bellowed more like bulls; and, I
confess, they looked a good deal like bulls about the head; besides I
noticed they had hoofs split like cattle. Oh! I had a good look at
them while Hans was loading his gun. They stayed by the water till
he was nearly ready; and when they galloped off, they went in a long
string one behind the other with the largest one in front, and another
large one in the rear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wildebeests!&rdquo; exclaimed Hendrik.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gnoos!&rdquo; cried Swartboy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they must have been wildebeests,&rdquo; said Von Bloom; &ldquo;Jan's
description corresponds exactly to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was quite true. Jan had correctly given many of the characteristic
points of that, perhaps, the most singular of all ruminant animals,
the wildebeest or gnoo (<i>Catoblepas gnoo</i>). The brush-like tuft over
the muzzle, the long hair between the fore-legs, the horns curving
down over the face, and then sweeping abruptly upward, the thick
curving neck, the rounded, compact, horse-shaped body, the long
whitish tail, and full flowing mane&mdash;all were descriptive of the
gnoo.</p>

<p>Even Tr&uuml;ey had not made such an unpardonable mistake. The
gnoos, and particularly the old bulls, bear a very striking resemblance
to the lion, so much so that the sharpest hunters at a distance can
scarce tell one from the other.</p>

<p>Jan, however, had observed them better than Tr&uuml;ey; and had they
been nearer, he might have further noticed that the creatures had red
fiery eyes and a fierce look; that their heads and horns were not unlike
those of the African buffalo; that their limbs resembled those of
the stag, while the rest corresponded well enough to his &ldquo;pony.&rdquo; He
might have observed, moreover, that the males were larger than the
females, and of a deeper brown. Had there been any &ldquo;calves&rdquo; with
the herd, he would have seen that these were still lighter-coloured&mdash;in
fact, of a white or cream colour.</p>

<p>The gnoos that had been seen were the common kind called by the
Dutch colonists &ldquo;wildebeests&rdquo; or wild-oxen, and by the Hottentots
&ldquo;gnoo&rdquo; or &ldquo;gnu,&rdquo; from a hollow moaning sound to which these
creatures sometimes give utterance, and which is represented by the
word &ldquo;gnoo-o-oo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They roam in vast flocks upon the wild karoos of South Africa: are
inoffensive animals, except when wounded: and then the old bulls are
exceedingly dangerous, and will attack the hunter both with horns
and hoof. They can run with great swiftness, though they scarce ever
go clear off, but, keeping at a wary distance, circle around the hunter,
curvetting in all directions, menacing with their heads lowered to
the ground, kicking up the dust with their heels, and bellowing like
bulls, or indeed like lions&mdash;for their &ldquo;rout&rdquo; bears a resemblance to the
lion's roar.</p>

<p>The old bulls stand sentry while the herd is feeding, and protect it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
both in front and rear. When running off they usually go in single
file, as Jan had represented.</p>

<p>Old bulls hang between the rear of the herd and the hunter: and
these caper back and forward, butting each other with their horns,
and often fighting apparently in serious earnest! Before the hunter
comes within range, however, they drop their conflict and gallop out
of his way. Nothing can exceed the capricious antics which these
animals indulge in, while trooping over the plain.</p>

<p>There is a second species of the same genus common in South Africa,
and a third inhabits still farther to the north; but of the last very
little is known. Both species are larger than the wildebeest, individuals
of either being nearly five feet in height, while the common
gnoo is scarce four.</p>

<p>The three kinds are quite distinct, and never herd together, though
each of them is often found in company with other animals. All three
are peculiar to the continent of Africa, and are not found elsewhere.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;brindled gnoo&rdquo; is the other species that inhabits the South of
Africa. It is known among the hunters and colonists as &ldquo;blauw
wildebeest&rdquo; (blue wild-ox). It is of a bluish colour&mdash;hence the name,
and &ldquo;brindled,&rdquo; or striped along the sides. Its habits are very similar
to those of the common gnoo, but it is altogether a heavier and duller
animal, and still more eccentric and ungainly in its form.</p>

<p>The third species is the &ldquo;ko-koon&rdquo; of the natives. It approaches
nearer to the brindled gnoo in form and habits; but as it is not found
except in the more central and less-travelled portions of Africa, less is
known about it than either of the others. It is, however, of the same
kind; and the three species, differing widely from any other animals
known, are entitled to form a distinct and separate genus.</p>

<p>They have hitherto generally been classed with the antelopes,
though for what reason it is hard to tell. They have far less affinity
with the antelope than with the ox; and the everyday observations
of the hunter and frontier boer have guided them to a similar conclusion&mdash;as
their name for these animals (wild-oxen) would imply. Observation
of this class is usually worth far more than the &ldquo;speculations&rdquo;
of the closet-naturalist.</p>

<p>The gnoo has long been the favourite food of the frontier farmer
and hunter. Its beef is well flavoured, and the veal of a gnoo-calf is
quite a delicacy. The hide is manufactured into harness and straps
of different sorts; and the long silky tail is an article of commerce.
Around every frontier farm-house large piles of gnoo and springbok
horns may be seen&mdash;the remains of animals that have been captured
in the chase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jaging de wildebeest&rdquo; (hunting the gnoo) is a favourite pastime
of the young boers. Large herds of these animals are sometimes
driven into valleys, where they are hemmed in, and shot down at will.
They can also be lured within range, by exhibiting a red handkerchief
or any piece of red cloth&mdash;to which colour they have a strong aversion.
They may be tamed and domesticated easily enough; but they are
not favourite pets with the farmer, who dreads their communicating
to his cattle a fatal skin-disease to which the gnoos are subject, and
which carries off thousands of them every year.</p>

<p>Of course Von Bloom and his companions did not stay to talk over
these points. They were too anxious about the fate of the missing
Hans, to think of anything else.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span></p>

<p>They were about to start out in search of him, when just at that
moment my gentleman was seen coming around the end of the lake,
trudging very slowly along, under the weight of some large and heavy
object, that he carried upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>A shout of joy was raised, and in a few moments Hans stood in their
midst.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE ANT-EATER OF AFRICA.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">H</span>ans was saluted by a volley of questions, &ldquo;Where have you been?
What detained you? What has happened to you? You're all safe and
sound? Not hurt, I hope?&rdquo; These and a few others were asked in a
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sound as a bell,&rdquo; said Hans; &ldquo;and for the rest of your inquiries
I'll answer them all as soon as Swartboy has skinned this 'aard-vark,'
and Totty has cooked a piece of it for supper; but I'm too hungry to
talk now, so pray excuse me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Hans gave this reply, he cast from his shoulders an animal nearly
as big as a sheep, covered with long bristly hair of a reddish-grey
colour, and having a huge tail, thick at the root, and tapering like a
carrot; a snout nearly a foot long, but quite slender and naked; a very
small mouth; erect pointed ears resembling a pair of horns; a low
flattish body; short muscular legs; and claws of immense length,
especially on the fore-feet, where, instead of spreading out, they were
doubled back like shut fists, or the fore hands of a monkey. Altogether
a very odd animal was that which Hans had styled an &ldquo;aard-vark,&rdquo;
and which he desired should be cooked for supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my boy,&rdquo; replied Von Bloom, &ldquo;we'll excuse you, the more so
that we are all of us about as hungry as yourself, I fancy. But I
think we may as well leave the 'aard-vark' for to-morrow's dinner.
We've a couple of peacocks here, and Totty will get one of them ready
sooner than the aard-vark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for that,&rdquo; rejoined Hans, &ldquo;I don't care which. I'm just in the
condition to eat anything&mdash;even a steak of tough old quagga, if I had
it; but I think it would be no harm if Swartboy&mdash;that is, if you're
not too tired, old Swart&mdash;would just peel the skin off this gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hans pointed to the 'aard-vark.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And dress him so that he don't spoil,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;for you
know, Swartboy, that he's a tit-bit&mdash;a regular <i>bonne bouche</i>&mdash;and it
would be a pity to let him go to waste in this hot weather. An aard-vark's
not to be bagged every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spreichen true, Mynheer Hans,&mdash;Swartboy know all dat.
Him skin and dress da goup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, so saying, Swartboy out knife, and set to work upon the carcass.</p>

<p>Now this singular-looking animal which Hans called an &ldquo;aard-vark,&rdquo;
and Swartboy a &ldquo;goup,&rdquo; was neither more or less than the
African ant-eater.</p>

<p>Although the colonists term it &ldquo;aard-vark,&rdquo; which is the Dutch for
&ldquo;ground-hog,&rdquo; the animal has but little in common with the hog
kind. It certainly bears some resemblance to a pig about the snout
and cheeks; and that, with its bristly hair and burrowing habits, has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
no doubt given rise to the mistaken name. The &ldquo;ground&rdquo; part of the
title is from the fact that it is a burrowing animal,&mdash;indeed, one of
the best &ldquo;terriers&rdquo; in the world. It can make its way under ground,
faster than the spade can follow it, and faster than any badger. In
size, habits, and the form of many parts of its body, it bears a striking
resemblance to its South American cousin the &ldquo;tamanoir,&rdquo; which of
late years has become so famous as almost to usurp the title of &ldquo;ant-eater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the &ldquo;aard-vark&rdquo; is just as good an ant-eater as he,&mdash;can
&ldquo;crack&rdquo; as thick-walled a house, can rake up and devour as many
termites as any &ldquo;ant-bear&rdquo; in the length and breadth of the Amazon
Valley. He has got, moreover, as &ldquo;tall&rdquo; a tail as the tamanoir, very
nearly as long a snout, a mouth equally small, and a tongue as extensive
and extensile. In claws he can compare with his American
cousin any day, and can walk just as awkwardly upon the sides of
his fore-paws with &ldquo;toes turned in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why, then, may I ask, do we hear so much talk of the &ldquo;tamanoir,&rdquo;
while not a word is said of the &ldquo;aard-vark?&rdquo; Every museum and
menagerie is bragging about having a specimen of the former, while
not one cares to acknowledge their possession of the latter! Why
this envious distinction? I say it's all Barnum. It's because the
&ldquo;aard-vark's&rdquo; a Dutchman&mdash;a Cape boer&mdash;and the boers have been
much bullied of late. That's the reason why zoologists and showmen
have treated my thick-tailed boy so shabbily. But it shan't be so any
longer; I stand up for the aard-vark; and, although the tamanoir
has been specially called <i>Myrmecophaga</i>, or ant-eater, I say that the
<i>Orycteropus</i> is as good an ant-eater as he.</p>

<p>He can break through ant-hills quite as big and bigger&mdash;some of
them twenty feet high&mdash;he can project as long and as gluey a tongue&mdash;twenty
inches long&mdash;he can play it as nimbly and &ldquo;lick up&rdquo; as
many white ants, as any tamanoir. He can grow as fat too, and
weigh as heavy, and, what is greatly to his credit, he can provide you
with a most delicate roast when you choose to kill and eat him. It is
true he tastes slightly of formid acid, but that is just the flavour that
epicures admire. And when you come to speak of &ldquo;hams,&rdquo;&mdash;ah! try
his! Cure them well and properly, and eat one, and you will never
again talk of &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; or &ldquo;Westphalian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hans knew the taste of those hams&mdash;well he did, and so too Swartboy;
and it was not against his inclination, but <i>con amore</i>, that the
latter set about butchering the &ldquo;goup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swartboy knew how precious a morsel he held between his fingers,&mdash;precious,
not only on account of its intrinsic goodness, but from its
rarity; for although the aard-vark is a common animal in South
Africa, and in some districts even numerous, it is not every day the
hunter can lay his hands upon one. On the contrary, the creature is
most difficult to capture; though not to kill, for a blow on the snout
will do that.</p>

<p>But just as he is easily killed when you catch him, in the same
proportion is he hard to catch. He is shy and wary, scarce ever
comes out of his burrow but at night; and even then skulks so silently
along, and watches around him so sharply, that no enemy can approach
without his knowing it. His eyes are very small, and, like most
nocturnal animals, he sees but indifferently; but in the two senses of
smell and hearing he is one of the sharpest. His long erect ears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
enable him to catch every sound that may be made in his neighbourhood,
however slight.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;aard-vark&rdquo; is not the only ant-eating quadruped of South
Africa. There is another four-footed creature as fond of white ants as
he; but this is an animal of very different appearance. It is a creature
without hair; but instead, its body is covered all over with a regular
coat of scales, each as large as a half-crown piece. These scales
slightly overlie each other, and can be raised on end at the will of the
animal. In form it resembles a large lizard, or a small crocodile, more
than an ordinary quadruped, but its habits are almost exactly like
those of the aard-vark. It burrows, digs open the ant-hills by night,
projects a long viscous tongue among the insects, and devours them
with avidity.</p>

<p>When suddenly overtaken, and out of reach of its underground
retreat, it &ldquo;clews&rdquo; up like the hedgehog, and some species of the
South American armadillos&mdash;to which last animal it bears a considerable
resemblance on account of its scaly coat of mail.</p>

<p>This ant-eater is known as the &ldquo;pangolin,&rdquo; or &ldquo;manis,&rdquo; but there
are several species of &ldquo;pangolin&rdquo; not African. Some are met with in
Southern Asia and the Indian islands. That which is found in South
Africa is known among naturalists as the &ldquo;long-tailed&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tem-minck&rdquo;
pangolin (<i>Manis Temminckii</i>).</p>

<p>Totty soon produced a roasted &ldquo;peacock,&rdquo; or rather a hastily-broiled
bustard. But, although, perhaps, not cooked &ldquo;to a turn,&rdquo; it was
sufficiently well done to satisfy the stomachs for which it was intended.
They were all too hungry to be fastidious, and, without a
word of criticism, they got through their dinner.</p>

<p>Hans then commenced relating the history of his day's adventure.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<div class="cap">HANS CHASED BY THE WILDEBEEST.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">&ldquo;W</span>ell,&rdquo; began Hans, &ldquo;you had not been gone more than an hour,
when a herd of wildebeests was seen approaching the vley. They
came on in single file; but they had broken rank, and were splashing
about in the water, before I thought of molesting them in any way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course I knew what they were, and that they were proper game;
but I was so interested in watching their ludicrous gambols, that I
did not think about my gun, until the whole herd had nearly finished
drinking. Then I remembered that we were living on dry biltongue,
and would be nothing the worse of a change. I noticed, moreover,
that in the herd of gnoos there were some young ones&mdash;which I was
able to tell from their being smaller than the rest, and also by their
lighter colour. I knew that the flesh of these is most excellent eating,
and therefore made up my mind we should all dine upon it.</p>

<p>I rushed up the ladder for my gun; and then discovered how imprudent
I had been in not loading it at the time you all went away.
I had not thought of any sudden emergency,&mdash;but that was very
foolish, for how knew I what might happen in a single hour or
minute even?</p>

<p>I loaded the piece in a grand hurry, for I saw the wildebeests
leaving the water; and, as soon as the bullet was rammed home, I
ran down the ladder. Before I had reached the bottom, I saw that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
had forgotten to bring either powder-horn or pouch. I was in too
hot a haste to go back for them, for I saw the last of the wildebeests
moving off, and I fancied I might be too late. But I had no intention
of going any great distance in pursuit. A single shot at them
was all I wanted, and that in the gun would do.</p>

<p>I hastened after the game, keeping as well as I could under cover.
I found, after a little time, that I need not have been so cautious.
The wildebeests, instead of being shy&mdash;as I had seen them in our old
neighbourhood&mdash;appeared to have very little fear of me. This was
especially the case with the old bulls, who capered and careered
about within an hundred yards' distance, and sometimes permitted me
to approach even nearer. It was plain they had never been hunted.</p>

<p>Once or twice I was within range of a pair of old bulls, who
seemed to act as a rearguard. But I did not want to shoot one of
them. I knew their flesh would turn out tough. I wished to get
something more tender. I wished to send a bullet into a heifer, or
one of the young bulls whose horns had not yet begun to curve. Of
these I saw several in the herd.</p>

<p>Tame as the animals were, I could not manage to get near enough
to any of these. The old bulls at the head always led them beyond
my range; and the two that brought up the rear, seemed to drive
them forward as I advanced upon them.</p>

<p>Well, in this way they beguiled me along for more than a mile;
and the excitement of the chase made me quite forget how wrong it
was of me to go so far from the camp. But thinking about the meat,
and still hopeful of getting a shot, I kept on.</p>

<p>At length the hunt led me into ground where there was no longer
any bush; but there was good cover, notwithstanding, in the ant-hills,
that, like great tents, stood at equal distances from each other
scattered over the plain. These were very large&mdash;some of them more
than twelve feet high&mdash;and differing from the dome-shaped kind so
common everywhere. They were of the shape of large cones, or
rounded pyramids, with a number of smaller cones rising around
their bases, and clustering like turrets along their sides. I knew
they were the hills of a species of white ant called by entomologists
<i>Termes bellicosus</i>.</p>

<p>There were other hills, of cylinder shape and rounded tops, that
stood only about a yard high; looking like rolls of unbleached linen
set upright&mdash;each with an inverted basin upon its end. These were
the homes of a very different species, the <i>Termes mordax</i> of the entomologists;
though still another species of <i>Termes</i> build their nests in
the same form.</p>

<p>I did not stop then to examine these curious structures. I only
speak of them now, to give you an idea of the sort of place it was, so
that you may understand what followed.</p>

<p>What with the cone-shaped hills and the cylinders, the plain was
pretty well covered. One or the other was met with every two
hundred yards; and I fancied with these for a shelter I should have
but little difficulty in getting within shot of the gnoos.</p>

<p>I made a circuit to head them, and crept up behind a large cone-shaped
hill, near which the thick of the drove was feeding. When I
peeped through the turrets, to my chagrin, I saw that the cows and
younger ones had been drawn off beyond reach, and the two old bulls
were, as before, capering between me and the herd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span></p>

<p>I repeated the man&#339;uvre, and stalked in behind another large
cone, close to which the beasts were feeding. When I raised myself
for a shot, I was again disappointed. The herd had moved off as
before, and the brace of bulls still kept guard in the rear.</p>

<p>I began to feel provoked. The conduct of the bulls annoyed me
exceedingly, and I really fancied that they knew it. Their man&#339;uvres
were of the oddest kind, and some of them appeared to be
made for the purpose of mocking me. At times they would charge
up very close&mdash;their heads set in a menacing attitude; and I must
confess that with their black shaggy fronts, their sharp horns, and
glaring red eyes, they looked anything but pleasant neighbours.</p>

<p>I got so provoked with them at last, that I resolved they should
bother me no longer. If they would not permit me to shoot one of
the others, I was determined they themselves should not escape scot-free,
but should pay dearly for their temerity and insolence. I resolved
to put a bullet through one of them, at least.</p>

<p>Just as I was about raising my gun to fire, I perceived that they
had placed themselves in attitude for a new fight. This they did by
dropping on their knees, and sliding forward until their heads came
in contact. They would then spring up, make a sudden bound forward,
as if to get uppermost, and trample one another with their
hoofs. Failing in this, both would rush past, until they were several
yards apart; then wheel round, drop once more to their knees, and
advance as before.</p>

<p>Hitherto I had looked upon these conflicts as merely playful; and
so I fancy most of them were. But this time the bulls seemed to be
in earnest. The loud cracking of their helmet-covered foreheads
against each other, their fierce snorting and bellowing, and, above
all, their angry manner, convinced me that they had really quarrelled,
and were serious about it.</p>

<p>One of them, at length, seemed to be getting knocked over repeatedly.
Every time he had partially risen to his feet, and before
he could quite recover them, his antagonist rushed upon him, and
butted him back upon his side.</p>

<p>Seeing them so earnestly engaged, I thought I might as well make
a sure shot of it, by going a little nearer; so I stepped from behind
the ant-hill, and walked towards the combatants. Neither took any
notice of my approach&mdash;the one because he had enough to do to guard
himself from the terrible blows, and the other because he was so
occupied in delivering them.</p>

<p>When within twenty paces I levelled my gun. I chose the bull
who appeared victor, partly as a punishment for his want of feeling
in striking a fallen antagonist, but, perhaps, more because his broadside
was towards me, and presented a fairer mark.</p>

<p>I fired.</p>

<p>The smoke hid both for a moment. When it cleared off, I saw the
bull that had been conquered still down in a kneeling attitude, but,
to my great surprise, the one at which I had aimed was upon his feet,
apparently as brisk and sound as ever! I knew I had hit him somewhere&mdash;as
I heard the 'thud' of the bullet on his fat body&mdash;but it
was plain I had not crippled him.</p>

<p>I was not allowed time for reflection as to where I had wounded
him. Not an instant indeed, for the moment the smoke cleared away,
instead of the bulls clearing off also, I saw the one I had shot at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
fling up his tail, lower his shaggy front, and charge right towards
me!</p>

<p>His fierce eyes glanced with a revengeful look, and his roar was
enough to have terrified one more courageous than I. I assure you I
was less frightened the other day when I encountered the lion.</p>

<p>I did not know what to do for some moments. I thought of setting
myself in an attitude of defence, and involuntarily had turned my
gun which was now empty&mdash;intending to use it as a club. But I saw
at once, that the slight blow I could deliver would not stop the onset
of such a strong fierce animal, and that he would butt me over, and
gore me, to a certainty.</p>

<p>I turned my eyes to see what hope there lay in flight. Fortunately
they fell upon an ant-hill&mdash;the one I had just emerged from. I saw
at a glance, that by climbing it I would be out of reach of the fierce
wildebeest. Would I have time to get to it before he could overtake
me?</p>

<p>I ran like a frightened fox. You, Hendrik, can beat me running
upon ordinary occasions. I don't think you could have got quicker to
that ant-hill than I did.</p>

<p>I was not a second too soon. As I clutched at the little turrets,
and drew myself up, I could hear the rattle of the wildebeest's hoofs
behind me, and I fancied I felt his hot breath upon my heels.</p>

<p>But I reached the top cone in safety; and then turned and looked
down at my pursuer. I saw that he could not follow me any farther.
Sharp as his horns were, I saw that I was safe out of their reach.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<div class="cap">BESIEGED BY THE BULL.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">&ldquo;W</span>ell,&rdquo; continued Hans, after a pause, &ldquo;I began to congratulate
myself on my fortunate escape; for I was convinced that but for the
ant-hill I would have been trampled and gored to death. The bull
was one of the largest and fiercest of his kind, and a very old one
too, as I could tell by the bases of his thick black horns nearly
meeting over his forehead, as well as by his dark colour. I had
plenty of time to note these things. I felt that I was now safe&mdash;that
the wildebeest could not get near me; and I sat perched upon the
top of the central cone, watching his movements with perfect
coolness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is true he did everything to reach my position. A dozen times
he charged up the hill, and more than once effected a lodgment
among the tops of the lower turrets, but the main one was too steep
for him. No wonder! It had tried my own powers to scale it.</p>

<p>At times he came so close to me in his desperate efforts, that I
could have touched his horns with the muzzle of my gun; and I
had prepared to give him a blow whenever I could get a good chance.
I never saw a creature behave so fiercely. The fact was, that I had
hit him with my bullet,&mdash;the wound was there along his jaw, and
bleeding freely. The pain of it maddened him; but that was not
the only cause of his fury, as I afterwards discovered.</p>

<p>Well. After several unsuccessful attempts to scale the cone, he
varied his tactics, and commenced butting the ant-heap as though
he would bring it down. He repeatedly backed, and then charged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
forward upon it with all his might; and, to say the truth, it looked
for some time as though he would succeed.</p>

<p>Several of the lesser cones were knocked over by his powerful
blows; and the hard tough clay yielded before his sharp horns, used
by him as inverted pick-axes. In several places I could see that he
had laid open the chambers of the insects, or rather the ways and
galleries that are placed in the outer crust of the hill.</p>

<p>With all this I felt no fear. I was under the belief that he would
soon exhaust his rage and go away; and then I could descend
without danger. But after watching him a good long spell, I was
not a little astonished to observe that, instead of cooling down, he
seemed to grow more furious than ever. I had taken out my
handkerchief to wipe the perspiration off my face. It was as hot as
an oven where I sat. Not a breath of air was stirring, and the rays
of the sun, glaring right down and then reflecting up again from the
white clay, brought the perspiration out of me in streams. Every
minute I was obliged to rub my eyes clear of it with the handkerchief.</p>

<p>Now, before passing the kerchief over my face, I always shook it
open; and each time I did so, I noticed that the rage of the wildebeest
seemed to be redoubled! In fact, at such times he would leave
off goring the heap, and make a fresh attempt to rush up at me,
roaring his loudest as he charged against the steep wall!</p>

<p>I was puzzled at this, as well as astonished. What could there be
in my wiping my face to provoke the wildebeest anew? And yet
such was clearly the case. Every time I did so, he appeared to swell
with a fresh burst of passion!</p>

<p>The explanation came at length. I saw that it was not the wiping
off the perspiration that provoked him. It was the shaking out of
my handkerchief. This was, as you know, of a bright scarlet colour.
I thought of this, and then, for the first time, remembered having
heard that anything scarlet has a most powerful effect upon the
wildebeest, and excites him to a rage resembling madness.</p>

<p>I did not wish to keep up his fury. I crumpled up the handkerchief
and buried it in my pocket&mdash;preferring to endure the perspiration
rather than remain there any longer. By hiding the scarlet,
I conceived a hope he would the sooner cool down, and go away.</p>

<p>But I had raised a devil in him too fierce to be so easily laid. He
showed no signs of cooling down. On the contrary, he continued to
charge, butt, and bellow, as vengefully as ever&mdash;though the scarlet
was no longer before his eyes.</p>

<p>I began to feel really annoyed. I had no idea the gnoo was so
implacable in his rage. The bull evidently felt pain from his wound.
I could perceive that he moaned it. He knew well enough it was
I who had given him this pain.</p>

<p>He appeared determined not to let me escape retribution. He
showed no signs of an intention to leave the place; but laboured
away with hoof and horns, as if he would demolish the mound.</p>

<p>I was growing very tired of my situation. Though not afraid that
the bull could reach me, I was troubled by the thought of being so
long absent from our camp. I knew I should have been there. I
thought of my little sister and brother. Some misfortune might
befall them. I was very sad about that, though up to that time I
had little or no fears for myself. I was still in hopes the wildebeest
would tire out and leave me, and then I could soon run home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span></p>

<p>I say, up to that time I had no very serious fears for myself&mdash;excepting
the moment or two when the bull was chasing me to the
hill; but that little fright was soon over.</p>

<p>But now appeared a new object of dread&mdash;another enemy, as
terrible as the enraged bull&mdash;that almost caused me to spring down
upon the horns of the latter in my first moments of alarm!</p>

<p>I have said that the wildebeest had broken down several of the
lesser turrets&mdash;the outworks of the ant-hill&mdash;and had laid open the
hollow spaces within. He had not penetrated to the main dome, but
only the winding galleries and passages that perforate the outer
walls.</p>

<p>I noticed, that, as soon as these were broken open, a number of
ants had rushed out from each. Indeed, I had observed many of
the creatures crawling outside the hill, when I first approached it,
and had wondered at this&mdash;as I knew that they usually keep under
ground when going and coming from their nests. I had observed all
this, without taking note of it at the time&mdash;being too intent in my
stalk to think of anything else. For the last half-hour I was too
busy watching the man&#339;uvres of the wildebeest bull, to take my
gaze off him for a moment.</p>

<p>Something in motion directly under me at length caught my eye,
and I looked down to see what it was. The first glance caused
me to jump to my feet; and, as I have already said, very nearly
impelled me to leap down upon the horns of the bull!</p>

<p>Swarming all over the hill, already clustering upon my shoes, and
crawling still higher, were the crowds of angry ants. Every hole
that the bull had made was yielding out its throng of spiteful
insects; and all appeared moving towards me!</p>

<p>Small as the creatures were, I fancied I saw design in their
movements. They seemed all actuated with the same feeling&mdash;the
same impulse&mdash;that of attacking me. I could not be mistaken in
their intent. They moved all together, as if guided and led by
intelligent beings; and they advanced towards the spot on which
I stood.</p>

<p>I saw, too, that they were the soldiers. I knew these from the
workers, by their larger heads and long horny mandibles. I knew
they could bite fiercely and painfully.</p>

<p>The thought filled me with horror. I confess it, I never was so
horrified before. My late encounter with the lion was nothing to
compare with it.</p>

<p>My first impression was that I would be destroyed by the termites.
I had heard of such things&mdash;I remembered that I had. It was that,
no doubt, that frightened me so badly, I had heard of men in their
sleep being attacked by the white ants, and bitten to death. Such
memories came crowding upon me at the moment, until I felt certain,
that if I did not soon escape from that spot, the ants would sting
me to death and eat me up!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<div class="cap">A HELPLESS BEAST.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">&ldquo;W</span>hat was to be done?&rdquo; continued Hans. &ldquo;How was I to avoid
both enemies? If I leaped down, the wildebeest would kill me to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
certainty. He was still there, with his fierce eye bent upon me continually.
If I remained where I was, I would soon be covered with
the swarming hideous insects, and eaten up like an old rag.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/illus-417.jpg" width="356" height="500" alt="HANS BESIEGED BY A WILDEBEEST." title="HANS BESIEGED BY A WILDEBEEST." />
<span class="caption">HANS BESIEGED BY A WILDEBEEST.</span></div>

<p>Already I felt their terrible teeth. Those that had first crawled
to my feet I had endeavoured to brush off; but some had got upon
my ankles, and were biting me through my thick woollen socks! My
clothes would be no protection.</p>

<p>I had mounted to the highest part of the cone, and was standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
upon its apex. It was so sharp I could scarcely balance myself, but
the painful stings of the insects caused me to dance upon it like a
mountebank.</p>

<p>But what signified those that had already stung my ankle, to the
numbers that were likely soon to pierce me with their venomous
darts? Already these were swarming up the last terrace. They
would soon cover the apex of the cone upon which I was standing.
They would crawl up my limbs in myriads&mdash;they would&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I could reflect no longer on what they would do. I preferred
taking my chance with the wildebeest. I would leap down. Perhaps
some lucky accident might aid me. I would battle with the gnoo,
using my gun. Perhaps I might succeed in escaping to some other
hill. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I was actually on the spring to leap down, when a new thought
came into my mind; and I wondered I had been so silly as not to
think of it before. What was to hinder me from keeping off the
termites? They had no wings&mdash;the soldiers have none&mdash;nor the
workers neither, for that matter. They could not fly upon me.
They could only crawl up the cone. With my jacket I could brush
them back. Certainly I could&mdash;why did I not think of it before?</p>

<p>I was not long in taking off my jacket. I laid aside my useless
gun, dropping it upon one of the lower terraces. I caught the
jacket by the collar; and, using it as a duster, I cleared the sides of
the cone in a few moments, having sent thousands of the termites
tumbling headlong below.</p>

<p>Pshaw! how simply the thing was done! why had I not done it
before? It cost scarcely an effort to brush the myriads away, and a
slight effort would keep them off as long as I pleased.</p>

<p>The only annoyance I felt now was from the few that had got
under my trousers, and that still continued to bite me; but these I
would get rid of in time.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;I remained on the apex, now bending down to beat back
the soldiers that still swarmed upward, and then occupying myself
in trying to get rid of the few that crawled upon me. I felt no
longer any uneasiness on the score of the insects&mdash;though I was not
a bit better off as regarded the bull, who still kept guard below. I
fancied, however, that he now showed symptoms of weariness, and
would soon raise the siege; and this prospect made me feel more
cheerful.</p>

<p>A sudden change came over me. A new thrill of terror awaited me.</p>

<p>While jumping about upon the top of the cone, my footing suddenly
gave way&mdash;the baked clay broke with a dead crash, and I sank
through the roof. My feet shot down into the hollow dome&mdash;till I
thought I must have crushed the great queen in her chamber&mdash;and I
stood buried to the neck.</p>

<p>I was surprised, and a little terrified, not by the shock I had experienced
in the sudden descent. That was natural enough, and a
few moments would have restored my equanimity; but it was something
else that frightened me. It was something that moved under
my feet as they 'touched bottom,'&mdash;something that moved and
heaved under them, and then passed quickly away, letting me still
farther down!</p>

<p>What could it be? Was it the great swarm of living ants that I
pressed upon? I did not think it was. It did not feel like them. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
seemed to be something bulky and strong, for it held up my whole
weight for a moment or two, before it slipped from under me.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, it frightened me very considerably; and I did
not leave my feet in its company for five seconds time. No: the
hottest furnace would scarce have scorched them during the time
they remained inside the dark dome. In five seconds they were on
the walls again&mdash;on the broken edges, where I had mounted up, and
where I now stood quite speechless with surprise!</p>

<p>What next? I could keep the ants off no longer. I gazed down
the dark cavity; they were swarming up that way in thick crowds.
I could brush them down no more.</p>

<p>My eyes at this moment chanced to wander to the bull. He was
standing at three or four paces distance from the base of the hill.
He was standing sideways with his head turned to it, and regarding
it with a wild look. His attitude was entirely changed, and so, I
thought, was the expression of his eye. He looked as if he had just
run off to his new position, and was ready to make a second start.
He looked as if something had also terrified him!</p>

<p>Something evidently had; for, in another moment, he uttered a
sharp rout, galloped several paces farther out, wheeled again, halted,
and stood gazing as before!</p>

<p>What could it mean? Was it the breaking through of the roof
and my sudden descent that had frightened him?</p>

<p>At first I thought so, but I observed that he did not look upward
to the top. His gaze seemed bent on some object near the base of
the hill&mdash;though from where I stood I could see nothing there to
frighten him.</p>

<p>I had not time to reflect what it could be, before the bull uttered
a fresh snort; and, raising its tail high into the air, struck off at full
gallop over the plain!</p>

<p>Rejoiced at seeing this, I thought no more of what had relieved me
of his company. It must have been my curious fall, I concluded;
but no matter now that the brute was gone. So seizing hold of my
gun, I prepared to descend from the elevated position of which I was
thoroughly tired.</p>

<p>Just as I had got half down the side, I chanced to look below; and
there was the object that terrified the old bull. No wonder. It
might have terrified anything,&mdash;the odd-looking creature that it was.
From out a hole in the clay wall protruded a long naked cylindrical
snout, mounted by a pair of ears nearly as long as itself, that stood
erect like the horns of a steinbuck, and gave to the animal that bore
them a wild and vicious look. It would have badly frightened me,
had I not known what it was; but I recognised it at once as one of
the most inoffensive creatures in the world&mdash;the 'aard-vark.'</p>

<p>His appearance accounted for the retreat of the bull, and also explained
why the ants had been crawling about on my first reaching
their hill.</p>

<p>Without saying a word, or making the slightest noise, I clubbed
my gun; and, bending downward, struck the protruded snout a blow
with the butt. It was a most wicked blow; and, considering the
service the creature had just done me in frightening off the wildebeest,
a most ungrateful return. But I was not master of my feelings
at the moment. I did not reflect&mdash;only that I liked aard-vark flesh&mdash;and
the blow was given.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span></p>

<p>Poor fellow! It did the job for him. With scarce a kick he
dropped dead in the opening he had scraped with his own claws.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;my day's adventures were not yet ended. They seemed as
though they were never to end. I had got the aard-vark over my
shoulders, and was about heading homeward, when, to my astonishment,
I observed that the bull-gnoo&mdash;not the one that had besieged
me, but his late antagonist&mdash;was still out upon the plain where I had
last seen him! I observed, moreover, that he was still in a sort of
half-lying, half-kneeling attitude, with his head close to the ground!</p>

<p>His odd movements seemed stranger than anything else. I
fancied he had been badly hurt by the other, and was not able to get
away.</p>

<p>At first I was cautious about going near him&mdash;remembering my
late narrow escape&mdash;and I thought of giving him a wide berth, and
leaving him alone. Even though wounded, he might be strong
enough to charge upon me; and my empty gun, as I had already
proved, would be but a poor weapon with which to defend myself.</p>

<p>I hesitated about going near him; but curiosity grew strong
within me, as I watched his queer man&#339;uvres; until at length I
walked up within a dozen yards of where he was kneeling.</p>

<p>Fancy my surprise on discovering the cause of his oblique movements.
No hurt had he received of any kind&mdash;not even a scratch;
but for all that, he was as completely crippled as if he had lost his
best pair of legs.</p>

<p>In a very singular manner was he rendered thus helpless. In his
struggle with the other bull, one of his fore-legs had, somehow or
other, got passed over his horn; and there it stuck&mdash;not only depriving
him of the use of the limb itself, but holding his head so close to
the ground that he was quite unable to stir from the spot!</p>

<p>At first I designed helping him out of his difficulty, and letting
him go. On second thoughts, I remembered the story of the husband-man
and the frozen snake, which quite changed my intention.</p>

<p>I next thought of killing him for venison; but having no bullet, I
did not like to beat him to death with my gun. Besides the aard-vark
was my load to camp, and I knew that the jackals would eat
the bull up before we could go back for him. I thought it probable
he would be safer left as he was&mdash;as these ravenous brutes, seeing
him alive, might not so readily approach him.</p>

<p>So I left him with his &ldquo;head under his arm,&rdquo; in hopes that we may
find him there to-morrow.</p>

<p>So ended Hans's narrative of his day's adventures.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE ELEPHANT'S SLEEPING-ROOM.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>he field-cornet was far from satisfied with his day's work. His first
attempt at elephant-hunting had proved a failure. Might it not be
always so?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the interest with which he listened to Hans's
narrative of the day's adventures, he felt uneasy in his mind when he
reflected upon his own.</p>

<p>The elephant had escaped so easily. Their bullets seemed to have
injured him not the least. They had only served to render him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
furious, and dangerous. Though both had hit him in places where
their wounds should have been mortal, no such effect was produced.
The elephant seemed to go off as unscathed, as if they had fired only
boiled peas at him!</p>

<p>Would it be always so?</p>

<p>True, they had given him but two shots. Two, if well directed,
may bring down a cow-elephant and sometimes a bull, but oftener it
requires ten times two before a strong old bull can be made to &ldquo;bite
the dust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But would any elephant wait until they could load and fire a
sufficient number of shots?</p>

<p>That was an undecided point with our tyro elephant-hunters. If
not, then they would be helpless indeed. It would be a tedious
business spooring the game afoot, after it had once been fired upon.
In such cases the elephant usually travels many miles before halting
again; and only mounted men can with any facility overtake him.</p>

<p>How Von Bloom sighed when he thought of his poor horses! Now
more than ever did he feel the want of them&mdash;now more than ever did
he regret their loss.</p>

<p>But he had heard that the elephant does not always make off when
attacked. The old bull had shown no intention of retreating, after
receiving their shots. It was the odd conduct of Swartboy that had
put him to flight. But for that, he would no doubt have kept the
ground, until they had given him another volley, and perhaps his
death-wound.</p>

<p>The field-cornet drew consolation from this last reflection. Perhaps
their next encounter would have a different ending. Perhaps a pair
of tusks would reward them.</p>

<p>The hope of such a result, as well as the anxiety about it, determined
Von Bloom to lose no time in making a fresh trial. Next morning,
therefore, before the sun was up, the hunters were once more upon
the trail of their giant game.</p>

<p>One precaution they had taken, which they had not thought of
before. All of them had heard that an ordinary leaden bullet will
not penetrate the tough thick skin of the great &ldquo;pachyderm.&rdquo; Perhaps
this had been the cause of their failure on the preceding day.
If so they had provided against the recurrence of failure from such a
cause. They had moulded a new set of balls of harder material,&mdash;solder
it should have been, but they had none. They chanced, however,
to be in possession of what served the purpose equally well&mdash;the
old &ldquo;plate&rdquo; that had often graced the field-cornet's table in his better
byegone days of the Graaf Reinet. This consisted of candlesticks,
and snuffer-trays, and dish-covers, and cruet-stands, and a variety of
articles of the real &ldquo;Dutch metal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of these were condemned to the alembic of the melting-pan;
and, mixed with the common lead, produced a set of balls hard
enough for the hide of the rhinoceros itself&mdash;so that this day the
hunters had no fears of failure upon the score of soft bullets.</p>

<p>They went in the same direction as upon the preceding day, towards
the forest or &ldquo;bush,&rdquo; as they termed it.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded a mile when they came upon the spoor of
elephants nearly fresh. It passed through the very thickest of the
thorny jungle&mdash;where no creature but an elephant, a rhinoceros, or a
man with an axe, could have made way. A family must have passed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
consisting of a male, a female or two, and several young ones of
different ages. They had marched in single file, as elephants usually
do; and had made a regular lane several feet wide, which was quite
clear of bushes, and trampled by their immense footsteps. The old
bull, Swartboy said, had gone in advance, and had cleared the way of
all obstructions, by means of his trunk and tusks. This had evidently
been the case, for the hunters observed huge branches broken off, or
still hanging and turned to one side, out of the way&mdash;just as if the
hand of man had done it.</p>

<p>Swartboy further affirmed, that such elephant-roads usually led to
water; and by the very easiest and shortest routes&mdash;as if they had
been planned and laid open by the skill of an engineer&mdash;showing the
rare instinct or sagacity of these animals.</p>

<p>The hunters, therefore, expected soon to arrive at some watering-place;
but it was equally probable the spoor might be leading them
from the water.</p>

<p>They had not followed it more than a quarter of a mile, when they
came upon another road of a similar kind, that crossed the one they
were spooring upon. This had also been made by a number of
elephants&mdash;a family most likely&mdash;and the tracks upon it were as
recent as those they had been following.</p>

<p>They hesitated for a moment which to take; but at length concluded
upon keeping straight on; and so they moved forward as
before.</p>

<p>To their great disappointment the trail at last led out into more
open ground, where the elephants had scattered about; and after
following the tracks of one, and then another without success, they
got bewildered, and lost the spoor altogether.</p>

<p>While casting about to find it in a place where the bush was thin
and straggling, Swartboy suddenly ran off to one side, calling to the
others to follow him. Von Bloom and Hendrik went after to see what
the Bushman was about. They thought he had seen an elephant,
and both, considerably excited, had already pulled the covers off their
guns.</p>

<p>There was no elephant, however. When they came up with Swartboy,
he was standing under a tree, and pointing to the ground at its
bottom.</p>

<p>The hunters looked down. They saw that the ground upon one
side of the tree was trampled, as though horses or some other animals
had been tied there for a long time, and had worn off the turf, and
worked it into dust with their hoofs. The bark of the tree&mdash;a full-topped
shady acacia&mdash;for some distance up was worn smooth upon one
side, just as though cattle had used it for a rubbing-post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has done it?&rdquo; asked the field-cornet and Hendrik in a
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Da olifant's slapen-boom&rdquo; (the elephant's sleeping-tree), replied
Swartboy.</p>

<p>No further explanation was necessary. The hunters remembered
what they had been told about a curious habit which the elephant
has&mdash;of leaning against a tree while asleep. This, then, was one of
the sleeping-trees of these animals.</p>

<p>But of what use to them, farther than to gratify a little curiosity?
The elephant was not there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Da ole karl come again,&rdquo; said Swartboy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! you think so, Swart?&rdquo; inquired Von Bloom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ya, baas, lookee da! spoor fresh&mdash;da groot olifant hab slap here
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then? you think we should lie in wait, and shoot him when
he returns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, baas, better dan shoot, we make him bed&mdash;den wait see um
lie down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swartboy grinned a laugh as he gave this piece of advice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make his bed! what do you mean?&rdquo; inquired his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, baas, we get da oliphant sure, if you leave da job to ole
Swart. I gib you de plan for take him, no waste powder, no waste
bullet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bushman proceeded to communicate his plan, to which his
master&mdash;remembering their failure of yesterday&mdash;readily gave his consent.</p>

<p>Fortunately they had all the implements that would be necessary
for carrying it out,&mdash;a sharp axe, a strong rope or &ldquo;rheim&rdquo; of raw-hide,
and their knives&mdash;and they set about the business without loss of
time.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<div class="cap">MAKING THE ELEPHANT'S BED.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">T</span>o the hunters time was a consideration. If the elephant should return
that day it would be just before the hottest hours of noon. They
had, therefore, scarce an hour left to prepare for him&mdash;to &ldquo;make his
bed,&rdquo; as Swartboy had jocosely termed it. So they went to work with
alacrity, the Bushman acting as director-general, while the other two
received their orders from him with the utmost obedience.</p>

<p>The first work which Swartboy assigned to them was to cut and
prepare three stakes of hard wood. They were to be each about three
feet long, as thick as a man's arm, and pointed at one end.</p>

<p>These were soon procured. The iron-wood which grew in abundance
in the neighbourhood, furnished the very material; and after three
pieces of sufficient length had been cut down with the axe, they were
reduced to the proper size, and pointed by the knives of the hunters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Swartboy had not been idle. First, with his knife he
had cut a large section of bark from the elephant's tree, upon the side
against which the animal had been in the habit of leaning, and about
three feet from the ground. Then with the axe he made a deep notch,
where the bark had been removed&mdash;in fact, such a notch as would have
caused the tree to fall had it been left to itself. But it was not, for
before advancing so far in his work, Swartboy had taken measures to
prevent that. He had stayed the tree by fastening the rheim to its
upper branches on the opposite side, and then carrying the rope to the
limbs of another tree that stood out in that direction.</p>

<p>Thus adjusted, the elephant's tree was only kept from falling by the
rheim-stay; and a slight push, in the direction of the latter, would
have thrown it over.</p>

<p>Swartboy now replaced the section of bark, which he had preserved;
and after carefully collecting the chips, no one, without close examination,
could have told that the tree had ever felt the edge of an axe.</p>

<p>Another operation yet remained to be performed&mdash;that was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
planting of the stakes, already prepared by Von Bloom and Hendrik.
To set these firmly, deep holes had to be made. But Swartboy was
just the man to make a hole; and in less than ten minutes he had
sunk three, each over a foot deep, and not a half-inch wider than the
thickness of the stakes!</p>

<p>You may be curious to know how he accomplished this. You would
have dug a hole with a spade, and necessarily as wide as the spade itself.
But Swartboy had no spade, and would not have used it if there
had been one&mdash;since it would have made the holes too large for his
purpose.</p>

<p>Swartboy sunk his holes by &ldquo;crowing&rdquo;&mdash;which process he performed
by means of a small pointed stick. With this he first loosened the
earth in a circle of the proper size. He then took out the detached
mould, flung it away, and used the point of the &ldquo;crowing stick&rdquo; as
before. Another clearing out of mould, another application of the
stick; and so on, till the narrow hole was deemed of sufficient depth.
That was how Swartboy &ldquo;crowed&rdquo; the holes.</p>

<p>They were sunk in a kind of triangle near the bottom of the tree,
but on the side opposite to that where the elephant would stand, should
he occupy his old ground.</p>

<p>In each hole Swartboy now set a stake, thick end down and point
upwards; some small pebbles, and a little mould worked in at the sides,
wedged them as firmly as if they had grown there.</p>

<p>The stakes were now daubed over with soft earth, to conceal the
white colour of the wood; the remaining chips were picked up, and
all traces of the work completely obliterated. This done the hunters
withdrew from the spot.</p>

<p>They did not go far; but choosing a large bushy tree to leeward,
all three climbed up into it, and sat concealed among its branches.</p>

<p>The field-cornet held his long &ldquo;roer&rdquo; in readiness, and so did Hendrik
his rifle. In case the ingenious trap of Swartboy should fail, they intended
to use their guns, but not otherwise.</p>

<p>It was now quite noon, and the day had turned out one of the
hottest. But for the shade afforded by the leaves, they would have
felt it very distressing. Swartboy prognosticated favourably from
this. The great heat would be more likely than anything else to send
the elephant to his favourite sleeping-place under the cool shady cover
of the cameel-doorn.</p>

<p>It was now quite noon. He could not be long in coming, thought
they.</p>

<p>Sure enough he came, and soon, too.</p>

<p>They had not been twenty minutes on their perch, when they heard
a strange, rumbling noise, which they knew proceeded from the
stomach of an elephant. The next moment they saw one emerge from
the jungle, and walk, with sweeping step, straight up to the tree. He
seemed to have no suspicion of any danger; but placed himself at once
alongside the trunk of the acacia&mdash;in the very position and on the side
Swartboy had said he would take. From his spoor the Bushman knew
he had been in the habit of so standing.</p>

<p>His head was turned from the hunters, but not so much as to prevent
them from seeing a pair of splendid tusks,&mdash;six feet long at the
least.</p>

<p>While gazing in admiration at these rich trophies, they saw the
animal point his proboscis upward, and discharge a vast shower of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
water into the leaves, which afterwards fell dripping in bright globules
over his body!</p>

<p>Swartboy said that he drew the water from his stomach. Although
closet-naturalists deny this, it must have been so; for shortly after,
he repeated the act again and again&mdash;the quantity of water at each
discharge being as great as before. It was plain that his trunk, large
as it was, could not have contained it all.</p>

<p>He seemed to enjoy this &ldquo;shower-bath;&rdquo; and the hunters did not
wonder at it, for they themselves, suffering at the time from heat and
thirst, would have relished something of a similar kind. As the
crystal drops fell back from the acacia leaves, the huge animal was
heard to utter a low grunt expressive of gratification. The hunters
hoped that this was the prelude to his sleep, and watched him with
intense earnestness.</p>

<p>It proved to be so.</p>

<p>As they sat gazing, they noticed that his head sunk a little, his ears
ceased their flapping, his tail hung motionless, and his trunk, now
twined around his tusks, remained at rest.</p>

<p>They gaze intently. Now they see his body droop a little to one
side&mdash;now it touches the tree&mdash;there is heard a loud crack, followed by
a confused crashing of branches&mdash;and the huge dark body of the
elephant sinks upon its side.</p>

<p>At the same instant a terrible scream drowns all other sounds, causing
the forest to echo, and the very leaves to quake. Then follows a
confused roaring, mingled with the noise of cracking branches, and the
struggles of the mighty brute where he lies kicking his giant limbs
along the earth, in the agonies of death!</p>

<p>The hunters remain in the tree. They see that the elephant is down&mdash;that
he is impaled. There will be no need for their puny weapons.
Their game has already received the death-wound.</p>

<p>The struggle is of short duration. The painful breathing that precedes
death is heard issuing from the long proboscis; and then follows
a deep ominous silence.</p>

<p>The hunters leap down, and approach the prostrate body. They see
that it still lies upon the terrible <i>chevaux de fris&eacute;</i>, where it had fallen.
The stakes have done their work most effectively. The elephant
breathes no more. He is dead!</p>

<p>It was the work of an hour to cut out those splendid tusks. But
our hunters thought nothing of that; and they were only the more
pleased to find each of them a heavy load&mdash;as much as a man could
carry!</p>

<p>Von Bloom shouldered one, Swartboy the other, while Hendrik
loaded himself with the guns and implements; and all three, leaving
the carcass of the dead elephant behind them, returned triumphantly
to camp.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE WILD ASSES OF AFRICA.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">N</span>otwithstanding the success of the day's hunt, the mind of Von
Bloom was not at rest. They had &ldquo;bagged&rdquo; their game, it was true,
but in what manner? Their success was a mere accident, and gave
them no earnest of what might be expected in the future. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
might go long before finding another &ldquo;sleeping-tree&rdquo; of the elephants,
and repeating their easy capture.</p>

<p>Such were the not very pleasant reflections of the field-cornet, on
the evening after returning from their successful hunt.</p>

<p>But still less pleasant were they, two weeks later, at the retrospect
of many an unsuccessful chase from which they had returned&mdash;when,
after twelve days spent in &ldquo;jaging&rdquo; the elephant, they had
added only a single pair of tusks to the collection, and these the
tusks of a cow elephant, scarce two feet in length, and of little
value!</p>

<p>The reflection was not the less painful, that nearly every day they
had fallen in with elephants, and had obtained a shot or two at these
animals. That did not mend the matter a bit. On the contrary, it
taught the hunter how easily they could run away from him, as they
invariably did. It taught him how small his chances were of
capturing such game, so long as he could only follow it afoot.</p>

<p>The hunter on foot stands but a poor chance with the elephant.
Stalking in upon one is easy enough, and perhaps obtaining a single
shot; but when the animal trots off through the thick jungle, it
is tedious work following him. He may go miles before halting, and
even if the hunter should overtake him, it may be only to deliver
a second shot, and see the game once more disappear into the bushes&mdash;perhaps
to be spoored no farther.</p>

<p>Now the mounted hunter has this advantage. His horse can
overtake the elephant; and it is a peculiarity of this animal, that
the moment he finds that his enemy, whatever it be, can do that
thing, he disdains to run any farther, but at once stands to bay;
and the hunter may then deliver as many shots as he pleases.</p>

<p>Herein lies the great advantage of the hunter on horseback.
Another advantage is the security the horse affords, enabling his
rider to avoid the charges of the angry elephant.</p>

<p>No wonder Von Bloom sighed for a horse. No wonder he felt
grieved at the want of this noble companion, that would have aided
him so much in the chase.</p>

<p>He grieved all the more, now that he had become acquainted with
the district, and had found it so full of elephants. Troops of an
hundred had been seen; and these far from being shy, or disposed
to make off after a shot or two. Perhaps they had never heard the
report of a gun before that of his own long roer pealed in their huge ears.</p>

<p>With a horse the field-cornet believed he could have killed many,
and obtained much valuable ivory. Without one, his chances of
carrying out his design were poor indeed. His hopes were likely
to end in disappointment.</p>

<p>He felt this keenly. The bright prospects he had so ardently
indulged in, became clouded over; and fears for the future once
more harassed him. He would only waste his time in this wilderness.
His children would live without books, without education, without
society. Were he to be suddenly called away, what would become
of them? His pretty Gertrude would be no better off than a little
savage&mdash;his sons would become not in sport, as he was wont to call
them, but in reality a trio of &ldquo;Bush-boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more these thoughts filled the heart of the father with pain.
Oh! what would he not have given at that moment for a pair of
horses, of any sort whatever?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span></p>

<p>The field-cornet, while making these reflections, was seated in the
great nwana-tree, upon the platform, that had been built on the side
towards the lake, and from which a full view could be obtained of
the water. From this point a fine view could also be obtained of the
country which lay to the eastward of the lake. At some distance off
it was wooded, but near the vley a grassy plain lay spread before the
eye like a green meadow.</p>

<p>The eyes of the hunter were turned outward on this plain, and just
then his glance fell upon a troop of animals crossing the open
ground, and advancing towards the vley.</p>

<p>They were large animals&mdash;nearly of the shape and size of small
horses&mdash;and travelling in single file; as they were, the troop at
a distance presented something of the appearance of a &ldquo;cafila,&rdquo; or
caravan. There were in all about fifty individuals in the line; and
they marched along with a steady sober pace, as if under the
guidance and direction of some wise leader. How very different
from the capricious and eccentric movements of the gnoos!</p>

<p>Individually they bore some resemblance to these last-named
animals. In the shape of their bodies and tails, in their general
ground colour, and in the &ldquo;brindled&rdquo; or tiger-like stripes that could
be perceived upon their cheeks, neck, and shoulders. These stripes
were exactly of the same form as those upon a zebra; but far less
distinct, and not extending to the body or limbs, as is the case with
the true zebra. In general colour, and in some other respects, the
animals reminded one of the ass; but their heads, necks, and the
upper part of their bodies, were of darker hue, slightly tinged with
reddish brown. In fact, the new-comers had points of resemblance
to all four&mdash;horse, ass, gnoo, and zebra&mdash;and yet they were distinct
from any. To the zebra they bore the greatest resemblance&mdash;for
they were in reality a species of zebra&mdash;they were quaggas.</p>

<p>Modern naturalists have divided the <i>Equid&aelig;</i>, or horse family, into
two genera&mdash;the horse and the ass&mdash;the principal points of distinction
being, that animals of the horse kind have long flowing manes,
full tails, and warty callosities on both hind and fore limbs; while
asses, on the contrary, have short, meagre, and upright manes,
tails slender and furnished only with long hairs at the extremity,
and their hind limbs wanting the callosities. These, however, are
found on the fore-legs as upon horses.</p>

<p>Although there are many varieties of the horse genus&mdash;scores of
them, widely differing from each other&mdash;they can all be easily
recognised by these characteristic marks, from the &ldquo;Suffolk Punch,&rdquo;
the great London drayhorse, down to his diminutive little cousin the
&ldquo;Shetland Pony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The varieties of the ass are nearly as numerous, though this fact
is not generally known.</p>

<p>First, we have the common ass, the type of the genus; and of this
there are many breeds in different countries, some nearly as elegant
and as highly prized as horses. Next there is the &ldquo;onagra,&rdquo; &ldquo;koulan,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;wild ass,&rdquo; supposed to be the origin of the common kind. This
is a native of Asia, though it is also found in the north-eastern parts
of Africa. There is also the &ldquo;dziggetai,&rdquo; or &ldquo;great wild ass,&rdquo; of
Central and Southern Asia, and another smaller species the &ldquo;ghur&rdquo;
found in Persia. Again, there is the &ldquo;kiang&rdquo; met with in Ladakh,
and the &ldquo;yo-totze,&rdquo; an inhabitant of Chinese Tartary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span></p>

<p>All these are Asiatic species, found in a wild state, and differing
from one another in colour, size, form, and even in habits. Many
of them are of elegant form, and swift as the swiftest horses.</p>

<p>In this little book we cannot afford room for a description of each,
but must confine our remarks to what is more properly our subject&mdash;the
wild asses of Africa. Of these there are six or seven kinds&mdash;perhaps
more.</p>

<p>First, there is the &ldquo;wild ass,&rdquo; which, as already stated, extends
from Asia into the north-eastern parts of Africa, contiguous to the
former continent.</p>

<p>Next there is the &ldquo;koomrah,&rdquo; of which very little is known, except
that it inhabits the forests of Northern Africa, and is solitary in
its habits, unlike most of the other species. The koomrah has been
described as a &ldquo;wild horse,&rdquo; but, most probably, it belongs to the
genus <i>asinus</i>.</p>

<p>Now there are four other species of &ldquo;wild asses&rdquo; in Africa&mdash;wild
horses some call them&mdash;and a fifth reported by travellers, but as
yet undetermined. These species bear such a resemblance to one
another in their form, the peculiar markings of their bodies, size, and
general habits, that they may be classed together under the title of
the zebra family. First, there is the true zebra, perhaps the most
beautiful of all quadrupeds, and of which no description need be
given. Second, the &ldquo;dauw,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Burchell's zebra,&rdquo; as it is more
frequently called. Third, the &ldquo;congo dauw,&rdquo; closely resembling the
dauw. Fourth, the &ldquo;quagga&rdquo;; and fifth, the undetermined species
known as the &ldquo;white zebra,&rdquo; so called from its pale yellow, or
Isabella colour.</p>

<p>These five species evidently have a close affinity with each other&mdash;all
of them being more or less marked with the peculiar transversal
bands or &ldquo;stripes,&rdquo; which are the well-known characteristics of the
zebra. Even the quagga is so banded upon the head and upper parts
of its body.</p>

<p>The zebra proper is &ldquo;striped&rdquo; from the tip of the nose to its very
hoofs, and the bands are of a uniform black, while the ground colour
is nearly white, or white tinged with a pale yellow. The &ldquo;dauws,&rdquo;
on the other hand, are not banded upon the legs; the rays are not
so dark or well defined, and the ground colour is not so pure or clean-looking.
For the rest, all these three species are much alike; and it
is more than probable that either &ldquo;Burchell's&rdquo; or the &ldquo;congo dauw&rdquo;
was the species to which the name of &ldquo;zebra&rdquo; was first applied; for
that which is now called the &ldquo;true zebra&rdquo; inhabits those parts of
Africa where it was less likely to have been the first observed of the
genus. At all events, the &ldquo;congo dauw&rdquo; is the &ldquo;hippotigris,&rdquo; or
tiger-horse, of the Romans; and this we infer from its inhabiting a
more northerly part of Africa than the others, all of which belong to
the southern half of that continent. The habitat of the zebra is said
to extend as far north as Abyssinia; but, perhaps, the &ldquo;congo dauw,&rdquo;
which certainly inhabits Abyssinia, has been mistaken for the true
zebra.</p>

<p>Of the four species in South Africa, the zebra is a mountain
animal, and dwells among the cliffs, while the dauw and quagga rove
over the plains and wild karoo deserts. In similar situations to these
has the &ldquo;white zebra&rdquo; been observed&mdash;though only by the traveller Le
Vaillant&mdash;and hence the doubt about its existence as a distinct species.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span></p>

<p>None of the kinds associate together, though each herds with other
animals! The quagga keeps company with the gnoo, the &ldquo;dauw&rdquo;
with the &ldquo;brindled gnoo,&rdquo; while the tall ostrich stalks in the midst
of the herds of both!</p>

<p>There is much difference in the nature and disposition of the different
species. The mountain zebra is very shy and wild; the dauw
is almost untameable; while the quagga is of a timid docile nature,
and may be trained to harness with as much facility as a horse.</p>

<p>The reason why this has not been done, is simply because the
farmers of South Africa have horses in plenty, and do not stand in
need of the quagga, either for saddle or harness.</p>

<p>But though Von Bloom the farmer had never thought of &ldquo;breaking
in&rdquo; a quagga, Von Bloom the hunter now did.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<div class="cap">PLANNING THE CAPTURE OF THE QUAGGAS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">U</span>p to this time the field-cornet had scarce deigned to notice the
quaggas. He knew what they were, and had often seen a drove of
them&mdash;perhaps the same one&mdash;approach the vley and drink. Neither
he nor any of his people had molested them, though they might have
killed many. They knew that the yellow oily flesh of these animals
was not fit for food, and is only eaten by the hungry natives&mdash;that
their hides, although sometimes used for grain-sacks and other common
purposes, are of very little value. For these reasons, they had
suffered them to come and go quietly. They did not wish to waste
powder and lead upon them; neither did they desire wantonly to
destroy such harmless creatures.</p>

<p>Every evening, therefore, the quaggas had drunk at the vley and
gone off again, without exciting the slightest interest.</p>

<p>Not so upon this occasion. A grand design now occupied the
mind of Von Bloom. The troop of quaggas became suddenly invested
with as much interest as if it had been a herd of elephants; and the
field-cornet had started to his feet, and stood gazing upon them&mdash;his
eyes sparkling with pleasure and admiration.</p>

<p>He admired their prettily-striped heads, their plump well-turned
bodies, their light elegant limbs; in short, he admired everything
about them, size, colour, and proportions. Never before had quaggas
appeared so beautiful in the eyes of the vee-boer.</p>

<p>But why this new-born admiration for the despised quaggas?&mdash;for
despised they are by the Cape farmer, who shoots them only to feed
his Hottentot servants. Why had they so suddenly become such
favourites with the field-cornet? That you will understand by
knowing the reflections that were just then passing through his mind.</p>

<p>They were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Might not a number of these animals be caught and broken in?&mdash;Why
not? Might they not be trained to the saddle?&mdash;Why not?
Might they not serve him for hunting the elephant just as well as
horses?&mdash;Why not?</p>

<p>Von Bloom asked these three questions of himself. Half a minute
served to answer them all in the affirmative. There was neither impossibility
nor improbability in any of the three propositions. It
was clear that the thing could be done, and without difficulty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span></p>

<p>A new hope sprang up in the heart of the field-cornet. Once more
his countenance became radiant with joy.</p>

<p>He communicated his thoughts both to the Bushman and &ldquo;Bush-boys&rdquo;&mdash;all
of whom highly approved of the idea, and only wondered
that none of them had thought of it before.</p>

<p>And now the question arose as to how the quaggas were to be
captured. This was the first point to be settled; and the four&mdash;Von
Bloom himself, Hans, Hendrik, and Swartboy,&mdash;sat deliberately
down to concoct some plan of effecting this object.</p>

<p>Of course they could do nothing just then, and the drove that had
come to drink was allowed to depart peacefully. The hunters knew
they would return on the morrow about the same hour; and it was
towards their return that the thoughts of all were bent.</p>

<p>Hendrik advised &ldquo;creasing,&rdquo; which means sending a bullet through
the upper part of the neck near the withers, and by this means a
quagga can be knocked over and captured. The shot, if properly
directed, does not kill the animal. It soon recovers, and may be
easily &ldquo;broken,&rdquo; though its spirit is generally broken at the same
time. It is never &ldquo;itself again.&rdquo; Hendrik understood the mode of
&ldquo;creasing.&rdquo; He had seen it practised by the boer-hunters. He knew
the spot where the bullet should hit. He believed he could do it
easily enough.</p>

<p>Hans considered the &ldquo;creasing&rdquo; too cruel a mode. They might
kill many quaggas before obtaining one that was hit in the proper
place. Besides there would be a waste of powder and bullets&mdash;a
thing to be considered. Why could they not snare the animals? He
had heard of nooses being set for animals as large as the quaggas,
and of many being caught in that manner.</p>

<p>Hendrik did not think the idea of snaring a good one. They
might get one in that way&mdash;the foremost of the drove; but all the
others, seeing the leader caught, would gallop off and return no more
to the vley; and where would they set their snare for a second? It
might be a long time before they should find another watering-place
of these animals; whereas they might stalk and crease them upon
the plains at any time.</p>

<p>Swartboy now put in his plan. It was the pit-fall. That was the
way by which Bushmen most generally caught large animals, and
Swartboy perfectly understood how to construct a pit for quaggas.</p>

<p>Hendrik saw objections to this, very similar to those he had
urged against the snare. The foremost of the quaggas might be
caught, but the others would not be fools enough to walk into the
pit&mdash;after their leader had fallen in and laid the trap open. They,
of course, would gallop off, and never come back that way again.</p>

<p>If it could be done at night, Hendrik admitted, the thing might be
different. In the darkness several might rush in before catching the
alarm. But no&mdash;the quaggas had always come to drink in day-time&mdash;one
only could be trapped, and then the others alarmed would
keep away.</p>

<p>There would have been reason in what Hendrik said, but for a
remarkable fact which the field-cornet himself had observed when
the quaggas came to the lake to drink. It was that the animals had
invariably entered the water at one point, and gone out at another.
It was of course a mere accident that they did so, and owing to the
nature of the ground; but such was the case, and Von Bloom had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
observed it on several occasions. They were accustomed to enter by
the gorge, already described; and, after drinking, wade along the
shallow edge for some yards, and then pass out by another break in
the bank.</p>

<p>The knowledge of this fact was of the utmost importance, and all
saw that at once. A pit-fall dug upon the path by which the animals
entered the lake, would no doubt operate as Hendrik said&mdash;one might
be caught, and all the rest frightened off. But a similar trap placed
upon the trail that led outward, would bring about a very different
result. Once the quaggas had finished drinking, and just at the
moment they were heading out of the water, the hunters could show
themselves upon the opposite side, set the troop in quick motion, and
gallop them into the trap. By this means not only one, but a whole
pit-full might be captured at once!</p>

<p>All this appeared so feasible that not another suggestion was offered&mdash;the
plan of the pit-fall was at once, and unanimously adopted.</p>

<p>It remained only to dig the pit, cover it properly, and then wait
the result.</p>

<p>During all the time their capture was being planned, the herd of
quaggas had remained in sight, disporting themselves upon the open
plain. It was a tantalizing sight to Hendrik, who would have liked
much to have shown his marksman skill by &ldquo;creasing&rdquo; one. But the
young hunter saw that it would be imprudent to fire at them there,
as it would prevent them from returning to the vley; so he restrained
himself, and along with the others remained watching the quaggas&mdash;all
regarding them with a degree of interest which they had never
before felt in looking at a drove of these animals.</p>

<p>The quaggas saw nothing of them, although quite near to the great
nwana-tree. They&mdash;the hunters&mdash;were up among the branches, where
the animals did not think of looking, and there was nothing around
the bottom of the tree to cause them alarm. The wagon-wheels had
long ago been disposed of in the bush, partly to shelter them from
the sun, and partly because game animals frequently came within
shot of the tree, and were thus obtained without any trouble. There
were scarce any traces upon the ground that would have betrayed
the existence of a &ldquo;camp&rdquo; in the tree; and a person might have
passed very near without noticing the odd a&euml;rial dwelling of the
hunter family.</p>

<p>All this was design upon the part of the field-cornet. As yet he
knew little of the country around. He did not know but that it
might contain worse enemies than either hyenas or lions.</p>

<p>While they sat watching the man&#339;uvres of the quaggas, a movement
was made by one of these creatures more singular than any that
had yet been witnessed.</p>

<p>The animal in question was browsing quietly along, and at length
approached a small clump of bushes that stood out in the open ground.
When close to the copse it was observed to make a sudden spring
forward; and almost at the same instant, a shaggy creature leaped
out of the bushes, and ran off. This last was no other than the ugly
&ldquo;striped&rdquo; hyena. Instead of turning upon the quagga and showing
fight, as one might have supposed so strong and fierce a brute would
have done, the hyena uttered a howl of alarm, and ran off as fast as
its legs would carry it.</p>

<p>They did not carry it far. It was evidently making for a larger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
tract of bush that grew near; but before it had got half-way across
the open ground, the quagga came up behind, and uttering his shrill
&ldquo;couaag,&rdquo; reared forward, and dropped with his fore-hoofs upon the
hyena's back. At the same instant the neck of the carnivorous animal
was clutched by the teeth of the ruminant and held as fast, as if
grasped by a vice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/illus-432.jpg" width="348" height="500" alt="THE QUAGGA AND THE HYENA." title="THE QUAGGA AND THE HYENA." />
<span class="caption">THE QUAGGA AND THE HYENA.</span></div>

<p>All looked to see the hyena free itself and run off again. They
looked in vain. It never ran another yard. It never came alive out
of the clutch of those terrible teeth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span></p>

<p>The quagga still held his struggling victim with firm hold&mdash;trampling
it with his hoofs, and shaking it in his strong jaws, until in a
few minutes the screams of the hyena ceased, and his mangled carcass
lay motionless upon the plain!</p>

<p>One would think that this incident might have been enough to
warn our hunters to be cautious in their dealings with the quagga.
Such a sharp biter would be no pleasant horse to &ldquo;bit and bridle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But all knew the antipathy that exists between the wild horse and
the hyena; and that the quagga, though roused to fury at the sight
of one of these animals, is very different in its behaviour towards
man. So strong, in fact, is this antipathy, and so complete is the
mastery of the ruminant over the carnivorous animal, that the frontier
farmers often take advantage of these peculiar facts, and keep the
hyenas from their cattle by bringing up with the herd a number of
quaggas, who act as its guards and protectors!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE PIT-TRAP.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">W</span>hile they were watching the movements of the quaggas, Von Bloom
rose suddenly to his feet. All turned their eyes upon him as he did
so. They saw by his manner that he was about to propose something.
What could it be?</p>

<p>The thought had just occurred to him that they should at once set
about digging the pit.</p>

<p>It was near sunset&mdash;wanting only half-an-hour of it; and one
would suppose he would have done better to leave the work till next
morning. But no. There was a good reason why they should set
about it at once; and that was, that they might not be able to complete
it in time if they did not do part of it that night.</p>

<p>It would be no slight undertaking to dig a pit of proper size, for
they would require one that would at least hold half-a-dozen quaggas
at a time. Then there was the carrying away the earth that should
come out of it, the cutting the poles and branches to cover it, and the
placing of these in a proper manner.</p>

<p>To do all these things would take up a great deal of time; and they
must be all done against the return of the quaggas, else the whole
scheme would be a failure. Should the animals arrive upon the
ground before the pit was covered in and all traces of the work
removed, they would make off without entering the water, and perhaps
never visit that vley again.</p>

<p>Such were the conjectures of the field-cornet. Hans, Hendrik, and
Swartboy, acknowledged their justice. All saw the necessity of going
to work at once, and to work they all went.</p>

<p>Fortunately among the &ldquo;implements,&rdquo; were two good spades, a
shovel, and a pick-axe, and all of them could be busy at the same
time. There were baskets in which the dirt could be carried off, and
thrown into the deep channel close by, where it would not be seen.
This was also a fortunate circumstance; for to have carried the stuff
any great distance, would have made the job still heavier, and more
difficult to execute in proper time.</p>

<p>Having marked the outlines of the pit, they went to work with spade,
shovel, and pick. The ground proved tolerably loose, and the pick was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
but little needed. The field-cornet himself handled one of the spades
Hendrik the other, while Swartboy acted as shoveller, and filled the
baskets as fast as Hans and Totty, assisted by Tr&uuml;ey and little Jan,
could empty them. These last carried a small basket of their own,
and contributed very materially to the progress of the work, by
lightening the labours of Hans and Totty.</p>

<p>And so the work went merrily on until midnight, and even after
that hour, under the light of a full moon; by which time the diggers
were buried to their necks.</p>

<p>But they were now fatigued. They knew they could easily complete
the pit next day; and so they laid down their implements, and after
performing their ablutions in the crystal water of the stream, retired
to their sleeping-quarters in the tree.</p>

<p>By early dawn they were at it again, busy as bees; and the pit progressed
so rapidly that before they stopped to take breakfast, Von
Bloom could scarce see out of it standing on his toes, and the crown
of Swartboy's woolly head was nearly two feet below the surface. A
little more digging would do.</p>

<p>After breakfast they went to work as briskly as ever; and laboured
away until they considered that the hole was sunk to a sufficient depth.
It would have taken a springbok to have leaped out of it; and no
quagga could possibly have cleared itself from such a pit.</p>

<p>Poles and bushes were now cut; and the pit was neatly covered
with these, and strewed over, as well as a large tract of the adjoining
ground, with rushes and grass. The most sagacious animal would
have been deceived by the appearance; even a fox could not have
discovered the trap before tumbling into it.</p>

<p>They had completed the work before going to dinner,&mdash;which, consequently,
fell late on that day&mdash;so nothing more remained to be done
but to dine, and await the coming of the quaggas.</p>

<p>At dinner they were all very merry, notwithstanding the immense
fatigue they had gone through. The prospect of capturing the quaggas
was very exciting, and kept the party in high spirits.</p>

<p>Each offered a prognostication as to the result. Some said they
would trap three quaggas at the least; while others were more
sanguine, and believed they might take twice that number. Jan did
not see why the pit should not be full; and Hendrik thought this
probable enough&mdash;considering the way they intended to drive the
quaggas into it.</p>

<p>It certainly seemed so. The pit had been made of sufficient width
to preclude the possibility of the animals leaping over it, while it was
dug lengthwise across the path, so that they could not miss it. The
lay of the ground would guide them directly into it.</p>

<p>It is true that, were they to be left to themselves, and permitted to
follow their usual method of marching&mdash;that is, in single file&mdash;only
one, the leader, might be caught. The rest, seeing him fall in, would
be sure to wheel round, and gallop off in a different direction.</p>

<p>But it was not the intention of the hunters to leave things thus.
They had planned a way by which the quaggas, at a certain moment,
would be thrown into a complete panic, and thus forced pell-mell upon
the pit. In this lay their hopes of securing a large number of the
animals.</p>

<p>Four was as many as were wanted. One for each of the hunters.
Four would do; but of course it mattered not how many more got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
into the pit. The more the better, as a large number would give them
the advantage of &ldquo;pick and choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dinner over, the hunters set about preparing for the reception of
their expected visitors. As already stated, the dinner had been later
than usual; and it was now near the hour when the quaggas might
be looked for.</p>

<p>In order to be in time, each took his station. Hans, Hendrik, and
Swartboy, placed themselves in ambush around the lake&mdash;at intervals
from one another; but the lower end, where the animals usually
approached and went out, was left quite open. Von Bloom remained
on the platform in the tree, so as to mark the approach of the quaggas,
and give warning by a signal to the other three. The positions taken
by these were such, that they could guide the herd in the direction of
the pit, by merely coming out of the bushes where they lay concealed.
In order that they should show themselves simultaneously, and at the
proper moment, they were to wait for a signal from the tree. This
was to be the firing of the great &ldquo;roer,&rdquo; loaded blank. Hans and
Hendrik were also to fire blank shots on discovering themselves, and
by this means the desired panic would be produced.</p>

<p>The whole scheme was well contrived, and succeeded admirably.
The herd appeared filing over the plain, just as on the preceding days.
Von Bloom announced their approach to the three in ambush, by repeating
in a subdued tone the words,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quaggas are coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unsuspecting animals filed through the gorge, scattered about
in the water, drank their fill, and then commenced retiring by the path
on which lay the trap.</p>

<p>The leader having climbed the bank, and seeing the fresh grass and
rushes strewed upon the path, uttered a snorting bark, and seemed
half inclined to wheel round. But just at that moment boomed the
loud detonation of the roer; and, then, like lesser echoes, the reports
of the smaller guns on the right and left, while Swartboy shouted at
the top pitch of his voice, from another quarter.</p>

<p>A look back showed the quaggas that they were well-nigh surrounded
by strange enemies. But one course appeared open to them&mdash;the
way they were wont to go; and barking with affright, the whole
drove dashed up the bank, and crowded on towards the pit.</p>

<p>Then was heard a confused noise&mdash;the cracking of the poles&mdash;the
trampling of many hoofs&mdash;the dull sounds of heavy bodies falling together,
and mingling in a continuous struggle&mdash;and the wild snorting,
as the creatures hurried forward in affright. Some were seen springing
high in the air, as if to overleap the pit. Others poised themselves
on their hind hoofs, and wheeling round, ran back into the lake.
Some dashed off through the bushes, and escaped in that way; but
the great body of the drove came running back, and plunging through
the water, made off by the gorge through which they had come. In a
few minutes not one was in sight.</p>

<p>The boys thought they had all escaped; but Von Bloom, from his
more elevated position in the tree, could perceive the snouts of several
protruding above the edge of the pit.</p>

<p>On arriving at the spot, to their great satisfaction the hunters discovered
no less than eight full-grown quaggas in the trap&mdash;just twice
the number required to mount the party.</p>

<p>In less than two weeks from that time, four of the quaggas were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
broken to the saddle, and perfectly obedient to the bit. Of course
there was a good deal of kicking, and plunging, and flinging, and many
hard gallops, and some ugly falls, before it came to this; but both the
Bushman Swartboy and the Bush-boy Hendrik were expert in the
<i>man&egrave;ge</i> of horses, and soon tamed the quaggas to a proper degree of
docility.</p>

<p>Upon the very first occasion when these animals were used in the
hunt of the elephant, they rendered the very service expected of them.
The elephant, as usual, bolted after receiving the first shot; but the
hunters on &ldquo;quagga-back&rdquo; were enabled to keep him in sight, and
follow rapidly upon his heels. As soon as the elephant discovered
that, run as he would, his pursuers had the power of overtaking him,
he disdained to fly farther, and stood to bay; thus giving them the
opportunity of delivering shot after shot, until a mortal wound brought
his huge body to the earth.</p>

<p>Von Bloom was delighted. His hopes were high, his benignant star
was once more in the ascendant.</p>

<p>He would yet accomplish his design. He would yet be rich. A few
years, would enable him to build up his fortune&mdash;to construct a
pyramid of ivory!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">DRIVING IN THE ELAND.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">O</span>f all the family Hendrik was the hunter <i>par excellence</i>. It was he
who habitually stored the larder; and upon days when they were
not engaged in the chase of the elephant, Hendrik would be abroad
alone in pursuit of antelopes, and other creatures, that furnished
their usual subsistence. Hendrik kept the table well supplied.</p>

<p>Antelopes are the principal game of South Africa&mdash;for Africa is
the country of the antelope above all others. You may be surprised
to hear that there are seventy different species of antelopes over all
the earth&mdash;that more than fifty of these are African, and that thirty
at least belong to South Africa&mdash;that is, the portion of the continent
lying between the Cape of Good Hope and the Tropic of Capricorn.</p>

<p>It would require the space of a whole book, therefore, to give a fair
account&mdash;a monograph&mdash;of the antelopes alone; and I cannot afford
that space here. At present I can only say that Africa is the great
antelope country, although many fine species exist also in Asia&mdash;that
in America there is but one kind, the prong-horn, with which you
are already well acquainted&mdash;and that in Europe there are two,
though one of these, the well-known &ldquo;chamois,&rdquo; is as much goat as
antelope.</p>

<p>I shall farther remark, that the seventy species of animals, by
naturalists classed as antelopes, differ widely from one another in
form, size, colour, pelage, habits; in short, in so many respects, that
their classification under the name of Antelope is very arbitrary
indeed. Some approximate closely to the goat tribe; others are
more like deer; some resemble oxen; others are closely allied to the
buffalo; while a few species possess many of the characteristics of
wild sheep!</p>

<p>As a general thing, however, they are more like to deer than
any other animals; and many species of them are, in common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
parlance, called deer. Indeed, many antelopes are more like to
certain species of deer than to others of their own kind. The chief
distinction noted between them and the deer is, that the antelopes
have horny horns, that are persistent or permanent, while those of
the deer are osseous or bony, and are annually cast.</p>

<p>Like the deer the different species of antelopes possess very
different habits. Some frequent the wide open plains; some the
deep forest; some wander by the shady banks of streams; while
others love to dwell upon the rocky steep, or the dry ravines of the
mountains. Some browse upon the grass; while others, goat-like,
prefer the leaves and tender twigs of trees. In fact, so different are
these creatures in habits, that whatever be the natural character of
a district of country, it will be found the favourite home of one
or more species. Even the very desert has its antelopes, that prefer
the parched and waterless plain to the most fertile and verdant
valley.</p>

<p>Of all antelopes the &ldquo;eland,&rdquo; or &ldquo;caana&rdquo; is the largest. It
measures full seventeen hands at the shoulder&mdash;being thus equal in
height to a very large horse. A large eland weighs one thousand
pounds. It is a heavily formed animal, and an indifferent runner, as
a mounted hunter can gallop up to one without effort. Its general
proportions are not unlike those of a common ox, but its horns are
straight and rise vertically from the crown, diverging only slightly
from one another. These are two feet in length, and marked by
a ridge that passes spirally around them nearly to the tips. The
horns of the female are longer than those of the male.</p>

<p>The eyes of the eland, like those of most antelopes, are large,
bright, and melting, without any expression of fierceness; and the
animal, though so very large and strong, is of the most innocuous
disposition&mdash;showing fight only when driven to desperation.</p>

<p>The general colour of this antelope is dun, with a rufous tinge.
Sometimes ashy grey touched with ochre is the prevailing hue.</p>

<p>The eland is one of those antelopes that appear to be independent
of water. It is met with upon the desert plains, far from either
spring or stream; and it even seems to prefer such situations&mdash;perhaps
from the greater security it finds there&mdash;though it is also
a denizen of the fertile and wooded districts. It is gregarious, the
sexes herding separately, and in groups of from ten to a hundred
individuals.</p>

<p>The flesh of the eland is highly esteemed, and does not yield in
delicacy to that of any of the antelope, deer, or bovine tribes. It
has been compared to tender beef with a game flavour; and the
muscles of the thighs when cured and dried produce a <i>bonne bouche</i>,
known under the odd appellation of &ldquo;thigh-tongues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course the eland affording such excellent meat, and in so large
a quantity, is zealously hunted for his spoils. Being only a poor
runner and always very fat, the hunt is usually a short one; and
ends in the eland being shot down, skinned, and cut up. There is no
great excitement about this chase, except that it is not every day an
eland can be started. The ease with which they can be captured, as
well as the value of their venison, has led to the thinning off of
these antelopes; and it is only in remote districts where a herd of
them can be found.</p>

<p>Now since their arrival, no elands had been seen, though now and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
then their spoor was observed; and Hendrik, for several reasons,
was very desirous of getting one. He had never shot an eland in his
life&mdash;that was one reason&mdash;and another was, that he wished to
procure a supply of the fine venison which lies in such quantities
over the ribs of these animals.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with great delight, that Hendrik one morning
received the report that a herd of elands had been seen upon the
upper plain, and not far off. Swartboy, who had been upon the
cliffs, brought this report to camp.</p>

<p>Without losing any more time than sufficed to get the direction
from Swartboy, Hendrik mounted his quagga, shouldered his rifle,
and rode off in search of the herd.</p>

<p>Not far from the camp there was an easy pass, leading up the cliff
to the plain above. It was a sort of gorge or ravine; and from the
numerous tracks of animals in its bottom, it was evidently much
used as a road from the upper plain to that in which were the spring
and stream. Certain animals, such as the zebras and quaggas, and
others that frequent the dry desert plains from preference, were
in the habit of coming by this path when they required water.</p>

<p>Up the gorge rode Hendrik; and no sooner had he arrived at its
top, than he discovered the herd of elands&mdash;seven old bulls&mdash;about
a mile off upon the upper plain.</p>

<p>There was not cover enough to have sheltered a fox. The only
growth near the spot where the elands were, consisted of straggling
aloe plants, euphorbias, with some stunted bushes, and tufts of dry
grass, characteristic of the desert. There was no clump large enough
to have sheltered a hunter from the eye of his game; and Hendrik
at once came to the conclusion, that the elands could not be &ldquo;stalked&rdquo;
in the situation they then occupied.</p>

<p>Now, though Hendrik had never hunted this antelope, he was
well acquainted with its habits, and knew how it ought to be chased.
He knew that it was a bad runner; that any old horse could bring
up with it; and that his quagga&mdash;the fastest of the four that had
been tamed&mdash;could do the same.</p>

<p>It was only a question of &ldquo;start,&rdquo; therefore. Could he get near
enough the bulls to have a fair start, he would run one of them down
to a certainty. The result might be different should the elands take
the alarm at a long distance off, and scour away over the plain.</p>

<p>To get within fair starting distance, that was the point to be
attempted.</p>

<p>But Hendrik was a wary hunter, and soon accomplished this.
Instead of riding direct for the elands, he made a grand circuit&mdash;until
he had got the herd between him and the cliff&mdash;and then,
heading his quagga for them, he rode quietly forward.</p>

<p>He did not sit erect in the saddle, but held himself bent down,
until his breast almost touched the withers of the quagga. This he
did to deceive the elands, who would otherwise have recognised him
as an enemy. In such a fashion they could not make out what kind
of creature was coming towards them; but stood for a long while
gazing at Hendrik and his quagga with feelings of curiosity, and of
course some little alarm.</p>

<p>They, however, permitted the hunter to get within five hundred
yards distance&mdash;near enough for him&mdash;before they broke off in their
heavy lumbering gallop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span></p>

<p>Hendrik now rose in his saddle, put spurs to his quagga, and
followed the herd at full speed.</p>

<p>As he had designed, so it came to pass. The elands ran straight
in the direction of the cliff&mdash;not where the pass was, but where there
was none&mdash;and, on reaching the precipice, were of course forced to
turn into a new direction, transverse to their former one. This gave
Hendrik the advantage, who, heading his quagga diagonally, was
soon upon the heels of the herd.</p>

<p>It was Hendrik's intention to single out one of the bulls, and run
him down&mdash;leaving the others to gallop off wherever they wished.</p>

<p>His intention was carried out; for shortly after, the fattest of the
bulls shot to one side, as if to escape in that way, while the rest
ran on.</p>

<p>The bull was not so cunning as he thought himself. Hendrik's
eye was upon him; and in a moment the quagga was turned upon
his track.</p>

<p>Another burst carried both game and pursuer nearly a mile across
the plain. The eland had turned from a rufous dun colour to that
of a leaden blue; the saliva fell from his lips in long streamers, foam
dappled his broad chest, the tears rolled out of his big eyes, and his
gallop became changed to a weary trot. He was evidently &ldquo;blown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few minutes more the quagga was close upon his heels; and
then the huge antelope, seeing that farther running could not serve
him, halted in despair, and faced round towards his pursuer.</p>

<p>Now Hendrik had his loaded rifle in his hand, and you expect to
hear that he instantly raised it to his shoulder, took aim, fired, and
brought down the eland.</p>

<p>I must disappoint you, then, by telling you that he did no such thing.</p>

<p>Hendrik was a real hunter&mdash;neither rash nor wasteful of his resources.
He knew a better plan than to kill the eland upon the spot.
He knew that the animal was now quite in his power; and that he
could drive him wherever he pleased, just like a tame ox. To have
killed the creature on the spot would have been a waste of powder
and shot. More than that, it would have rendered necessary all the
trouble of transporting its flesh to camp&mdash;a double journey at least&mdash;and
with the risk of the hyenas eating up most of it in his absence.
Whereas he could save all this trouble by driving the eland to camp;
and this was his design.</p>

<p>Without firing a shot, therefore, he galloped on past the blown
bull, headed him, turned him round, and then drove him before him
in the direction of the cliff.</p>

<p>The bull could make neither resistance nor opposition. Now and
again he would turn and trot off in a contrary direction; but he was
easily headed again, and at length forced forward to the top of the
pass.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<div class="cap">A WILD RIDE ON QUAGGA-BACK.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">H</span>endrik was congratulating himself on his success. He anticipated
some pleasure in the surprise he was about to create at camp, when
he should march in with the eland&mdash;for he had no doubt that he
would succeed in doing so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, there appeared no reason to doubt it. The bull had
already entered the gorge, and was moving down it, while Hendrik
and his quagga were hurrying forward to follow.</p>

<p>The hunter had arrived within a few yards of the top, when a loud
trampling noise sounded in his ears, as if a band of heavy-footed
animals were coming up the gorge.</p>

<p>He spurred his quagga forward, in order to reach the edge, and
get a view down the ravine. Before he was able to do so, he was
surprised to see the eland gallop up again, and try to pass him upon
the plain. It had evidently received fresh alarm, from something in
the gorge; and preferred facing its old enemy to encountering the
new.</p>

<p>Hendrik did not give his attention to the eland. He could ride it
down at any time. He was more anxious first to know what had
given it the start backward; so he continued to press forward to the
head of the ravine.</p>

<p>He might have thought of lions, and acted with greater prudence;
but the trampling of hoofs which still echoed up the pass told him
that lions were not the cause of the eland's alarm.</p>

<p>He at length reached a point where he could see down the declivity.
He had not far to look&mdash;for already the animals that were making
the noise were close up to him; and he perceived they were nothing
more than a troop of quaggas.</p>

<p>He was not over-pleased at this interruption to his drive; and the
less did he like it, that the intruders were quaggas&mdash;ill-conditioned
brutes that they were! Had they been game animals, he would have
shot one; but the only motive that would have induced him to shoot
one of the quaggas would have been a feeling of anger&mdash;for, at that
moment, he was really angry at them.</p>

<p>Without knowing it, poor brutes! they had likely given him cause
for a good deal of trouble: for it would cost him a good deal, before
he could head the eland again, and get it back into the pass. No
wonder, then, he was vexed a little.</p>

<p>But his vexation was not so grievous as to cause him to fire upon
the approaching herd; and, turning aside, he rode after the eland.</p>

<p>He had hardly left the spot, when the quaggas came out of the
pass, following each other to the number of forty or fifty. Each, as
he saw the mounted hunter, started with affright, and bolted off,
until the whole drove stretched out in a long line over the plain,
snorting and uttering their loud &ldquo;coua-a-g&rdquo; as they ran.</p>

<p>Hendrik would hardly have regarded this movement under ordinary
circumstances. He had often seen herds of quaggas, and was in no
way curious about them. But his attention was drawn to this herd,
from his noticing, as they passed him, that four of them had their
tails docked short; and from this circumstance, he recognised them
as the four that had been caught in the pit-trap and afterwards set
free. Swartboy, for some purpose of his own, had cut off the hair
before letting them go.</p>

<p>Hendrik had no doubt it was they, and that the herd was the same
that used to frequent the vley, but that on account of the ill-treatment
they had met with, had never since shown themselves in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Now these circumstances coming into Hendrik's mind at the
moment, led him to regard the quaggas with a certain feeling of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
curiosity. The sudden fright which the animals took on seeing him,
and the comic appearance of the four with the stumped tails, rather
inclined Hendrik towards merriment, and he laughed as he galloped
along.</p>

<p>As the quaggas went off in the same direction which the eland had
taken, of course Hendrik's road and theirs lay so far together; and
on galloped he at their heels. He was curious to try the point&mdash;much
disputed in regard to horses&mdash;how far a mounted quagga would be
able to cope with an unmounted one. He was curious moreover,
to find out whether his own quagga was quite equal to any of its old
companions. So on swept the chase, the eland leading, the quaggas
after, and Hendrik bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Hendrik had no need to ply the spur. His gallant steed flew like the
wind. He seemed to feel that his character was staked upon the
race. He gained upon the drove at every spring.</p>

<p>The heavy-going eland was soon overtaken, and as it trotted to
one side, was passed. It halted, but the quaggas kept on.</p>

<p>Not only the drove kept on, but Hendrik's quagga following close
at their heels; and in less than five minutes they had left the eland
a full mile in their rear, and were still scouring onward over the
wide plain.</p>

<p>What was Hendrik about? Was he going to forsake the eland,
and let it escape? Had he grown so interested in the race? Was he
jealous about his quagga's speed, and determined it should beat all
the others?</p>

<p>So it would have appeared to any one witnessing the race from a
distance. But one who could have had a nearer view of it, would
have given a different explanation of Hendrik's conduct.</p>

<p>The fact was, that as soon as the eland halted, Hendrik intended
to halt also; and for that purpose pulled strongly upon his bridle.
But, to his astonishment, he found that his quagga did not share his
intention. Instead of obeying the bit, the animal caught the steel in
his teeth, and laying his ears back, galloped straight on!</p>

<p>Hendrik then endeavoured to turn the quagga to one side, and for
this purpose wrenched his right rein; but with such fierceness, that
the old bit-ring gave way&mdash;the bit slipped through the animal's jaws&mdash;the
head-stall came off with the jerk&mdash;and the quagga was completely
unbridled!</p>

<p>Of course the animal was now free to go just as he liked; and it
was plain that he liked to go with his old comrades. His old comrades
he well knew them to be, as his snorting and occasional neigh of
recognition testified.</p>

<p>At first Hendrik was disposed to look upon the breaking of his bit
as only a slight misfortune. For a boy he was one of the best riders
in South Africa, and needed no rein to steady him. He could keep
his seat without one. The quagga would soon stop, and he could
then repair the bit, and re-adjust the bridle which he still held in his
hands. Such were his reflections at first.</p>

<p>But their spirit began to alter, when he found that the quagga,
instead of lessening his pace, kept on as hard as ever, and the herd
still ran wildly before him without showing the slightest signs of coming
to a halt.</p>

<p>In fact, the quaggas were running through fear. They saw the
mounted hunter behind them in hot pursuit; and although their old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
comrade knew who they were, how were they to tell what he was,
with such a tall hunch upon his back? No quagga he, but some
terrible monster, they imagined, thirsting for their lives, and eager
to devour one and all of them!</p>

<p>No wonder they showed their heels in the best style they knew
how; and so well did they show them, that Hendrik's quagga&mdash;notwithstanding
his keen desire to get forward among them, and explain
away the awkward business upon his back&mdash;was not able to come an
inch closer.</p>

<p>He did not lose ground, however. His eagerness to regain his old
associates&mdash;to partake once more of their wild freedom&mdash;for he was
desperately tired of civilised society, and sick of elephant-hunting&mdash;all
these ideas crowded into his mind at the moment, and nerved him
to the utmost exertion. Could he only get up into the body of the
crowd&mdash;for the herd now ran in a crowd&mdash;a few whimpers would
suffice to explain&mdash;they would come to a halt at once,&mdash;they would
gather around him, and assist both with hoofs and teeth to get
&ldquo;shed&rdquo; of the ugly two-legged thing that clung so tightly to his
dorsal vertebr&aelig;.</p>

<p>It was &ldquo;no go,&rdquo; however. Although he was so close to their heels,
that they flung dust in his face, and small pebbles in the face of his
rider, to the no slight inconvenience of the latter; although he
&ldquo;whighered&rdquo; whenever he could spare breath, and uttered his &ldquo;couag,&mdash;couag!&rdquo;
in reality calling them by name, it was &ldquo;no go.&rdquo; They
would not stay. They would not hear.</p>

<p>And what did Hendrik during all this time? Nothing&mdash;he could
do nothing. He could not stay the impetuous flight of his steed.
He dared not dismount. He would have been hurled among sharp
rocks, had he attempted such a thing. His neck would have been
broken. He could do nothing&mdash;nothing but keep his seat.</p>

<p>What thought he? At first, not much. At first he regarded the
adventure lightly. When he was about completing his third mile, he
began to deem it more serious; and as he entered upon the fifth, he
became convinced that he was neither more nor less than in a very
awkward scrape.</p>

<p>But the fifth mile was left behind, and then a sixth, and a seventh;
and still the quaggas galloped wildly on&mdash;the drove actuated by the
fear of losing their liberty, and their old comrade by the desire of
regaining his.</p>

<p>Hendrik now felt real uneasiness. Where were they going? Where
was the brute carrying him? Perhaps off to the desert, where he
might be lost and perish of hunger or thirst! Already he was many
miles from the cliffs, and he could no longer tell their direction.
Even had he halted then and there, he could not tell which way to
turn himself. He would be lost!</p>

<p>He grew more than anxious. He became frightened in earnest.</p>

<p>What was he to do? Leap down, and risk his neck in the fall? He
would lose his quagga and his saddle as well&mdash;he regarded the eland
as already lost&mdash;he would have to walk back to camp, and get laughed
at on his return.</p>

<p>No matter for all that; his life was in danger if he kept on. The
quaggas might gallop twenty,&mdash;aye, fifty miles before halting. They
showed no symptoms of being blown&mdash;no signs of giving out. He
must fling himself to the ground, and let quagga and saddle go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span></p>

<p>He had formed this resolution, and was actually about to put it in
practice. He was just considering how he might best escape an ugly
fall&mdash;looking for a soft spot&mdash;when, all at once, a grand idea rushed
into his mind.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-443.jpg" width="500" height="347" alt="HENDRICK BLINDING THE QUAGGA." title="HENDRICK BLINDING THE QUAGGA" />
<span class="caption">HENDRICK BLINDING THE QUAGGA.</span></div>

<p>He remembered that in taming this same quagga and breaking him
to the saddle, he had been vastly aided by a very simple contrivance&mdash;that
was a &ldquo;blind.&rdquo; The blind was nothing more than a piece of
soft leather tied over the animal's eyes; but so complete had been its
effect, that it had transformed the quagga at once from a kicking
screaming creature into a docile animal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span></p>

<p>Hendrik now thought of the blind.</p>

<p>True, he had none. Was there nothing about him that would serve
as one? His handkerchief? No, it would be too thin. Hurrah!
His jacket would do!</p>

<p>His rifle was in the way. It must be got rid of. It must be dropped
to the ground. He could return for it.</p>

<p>It was let down as gently as possible, and soon left far behind.</p>

<p>In a twinkling Hendrik stripped off his jacket. How was it to be
arranged so as to blind the quagga? It would not do to drop it.</p>

<p>A moment's consideration served the ready boy to mature his plan.
After a moment he bent down, passed a sleeve upon each side under
the quagga's throat, and then knotted them together. The jacket
thus rested over the animal's mane, with the collar near its withers,
and the peak or skirt upon the small of its neck.</p>

<p>Hendrik next leaned as far forward as he could, and with his
extended arms pushed the jacket up the animal's neck, until the skirt
passed over its ears, and fell down it front of its face.</p>

<p>It was with some difficulty that the rider, bent down as he was,
could retain his seat; for as soon as the thick flap of cloth came down
over the eyes of the quagga, the latter halted as if he had been shot
dead in his tracks. He did not fall, however, but only stood still,
quivering with terror. His gallop was at an end!</p>

<p>Hendrik leaped to the ground. He was no longer afraid that the
quagga, blinded as he now was, would make any attempt to get off;
nor did he.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the broken bit-ring was replaced by a strong
rheim of raw leather; the bit inserted between the quagga's teeth,
the head-stall safely buckled, and Hendrik once more in the saddle,
with his jacket upon his back.</p>

<p>The quagga felt that he was conquered. His old associates were no
longer in sight to tempt him from his allegiance; and with these
considerations, aided by a slight dose of bit and spur, he turned his
head, and moved sullenly upon the back track.</p>

<p>Hendrik knew nothing about the route he should take. He followed
back the spoor of the quaggas to the place where he had dropped his
gun, which after riding a mile or two he recovered.</p>

<p>As there was no sun in the sky, nor other object to guide him, he
thought he could not do better than trace back the spoor; and
although it led him by many a devious route, and he saw nothing
more of his eland, before night he reached the pass in the cliff, and
was soon after sitting under the shadow of the nwana-tree, regaling a
most interested audience with the narrative of his day's adventures.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE GUN-TRAP.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">I</span>t was about this time that the field-cornet and his people were very
much annoyed by beasts of prey. The savoury smell which their
camp daily sent forth, as well as the remains of antelopes, killed for
their venison, attracted these visitors. Hyenas and jackals were
constantly skulking in the neighbourhood, and at night came around
the great nwana-tree in scores, keeping up their horrid chorus for
hours together. It is true that nobody feared these animals, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
children at night were safe in their a&euml;rial home, where the hyenas
could not get at them. But for all that, the presence of the brutes
was very offensive, as not a bit of meat&mdash;not a hide, nor rheim, nor
any article of leather&mdash;could be left below without their getting their
teeth upon it, and chewing it up. Quarters of venison they had
frequently stolen, and they had eaten up the leathern part of Swartboy's
saddle, and rendered it quite useless for a while. In short, so
great a pest had the hyenas grown to be, that it became necessary to
adopt some mode of destroying them.</p>

<p>It was not easy to get a shot at them. During the day they were
wary, and either hid themselves in caves of the cliff or in the burrows
of the ant-eater. At night they were bold enough, and came into
the very camp; but then the darkness hindered a good aim, and the
hunters knew too well the value of powder and lead to waste it on
a chance shot, though now and then, when provoked by the brutes,
they ventured one.</p>

<p>But some way must be thought of to thin the numbers of these
animals, or get rid of them altogether. This was the opinion of
everybody.</p>

<p>Two or three kinds of traps were tried, but without much success.
A pit they could leap out of, and from a noose they could free
themselves by cutting the rope by their sharp teeth!</p>

<p>At length the field-cornet resorted to a plan&mdash;much practised by
the boers of Southern Africa for ridding their farms of these and
similar &ldquo;vermin.&rdquo; It was the &ldquo;gun-trap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now there are several ways of constructing a gun-trap. Of course
a gun is the principal part of the mechanism, and the trigger pulled
by a string is the main point of the contrivance. In some countries
the bait is tied to the string, and the animal on seizing the bait
tightens the string, draws the trigger, and shoots itself. In this
way, however, there is always some uncertainty as to the result. The
animal may not place its body in the proper position with regard to
the muzzle, and may either escape the shot altogether, or may be
only &ldquo;creased,&rdquo; and of course get off.</p>

<p>The mode of setting the &ldquo;gun-trap&rdquo; in South Africa is a superior
plan; and the creature that is so unfortunate as to draw the trigger
rarely escapes, but is either killed upon the spot, or so badly wounded
as to prevent its getting away.</p>

<p>Von Bloom constructed his trap after the approved fashion, as
follows:&mdash;Near the camp he selected a spot where three saplings or
young trees grew, standing in a line, and about a yard between each
two of them. Had he not found these trees so disposed, stakes
firmly driven into the ground would have answered his purpose
equally well.</p>

<p>Thorn-bushes were now cut, and a kraal built in the usual manner&mdash;that
is with the tops of the bushes turned outwards. The size of
the kraal was a matter of no consequence; and, of course, to save
labour, a small one was constructed.</p>

<p>One point, however, was observed in making the kraal. Its door
of opening was placed so that two of the three saplings stood like
posts, one on each side of it; and an animal going into the enclosure
must needs pass these two trees.</p>

<p>Now for the part the gun had to play.</p>

<p>The weapon was placed in a horizontal position against two of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
saplings,&mdash;that is, the stock against the one outside the kraal, and
the barrel against one of the door-posts, and there firmly lashed.
In this position the muzzle was close to the edge of the entrance, and
pointing directly to the sapling on the opposite side. It was at such
a height as to have ranged with the heart of a hyena standing in the
opening.</p>

<p>The next move was to adjust the string. Already a piece of stick,
several inches in length, had been fixed to the small of the stock,
and, of course, behind the trigger. This was fastened transversely,
but not so as to preclude all motion. A certain looseness in its
adjustment gave it the freedom required to be worked as a lever&mdash;for
that was its design.</p>

<p>To each end of this little stick was fastened a string. One of
these strings was attached to the trigger; the other, after being
carried through the thimbles of the ramrod, traversed across the
entrance of the kraal, and was knotted upon the opposite side to the
sapling that stood there. This string followed the horizontal direction
of the barrel, and was just &ldquo;taut;&rdquo; so that any farther strain
upon it would act upon the little lever, and by that means pull
the trigger; and then of course &ldquo;bang&rdquo; would go the roer.</p>

<p>When this string was adjusted, and the gun loaded and
cocked, the trap was set.</p>

<p>Nothing remained to be done but bait it. This was not a difficult
task. It consisted simply in placing a piece of meat or carcass
within the enclosure, and there leaving it to attract the prowling
beasts to the spot.</p>

<p>When the gun had been set, Swartboy carried up the bait&mdash;the
offal of an antelope killed that day&mdash;and flung it into the kraal; and
then the party went quietly to their beds, without thinking more of
the matter.</p>

<p>They had not slept a wink, however, before they were startled by
the loud &ldquo;crack&rdquo; of the roer, followed by a short stifled cry that
told them the gun-trap had done its work.</p>

<p>A torch was procured, and the four hunters proceeded to the spot.
There they found the dead body of a huge &ldquo;tiger-wolf&rdquo; lying doubled
up in the entrance, and right under the muzzle of the gun. He had
not gone a step after receiving the shot&mdash;in fact, had hardly kicked
before dying&mdash;as the bullet, wad, and all, had gone quite through his
ribs and entered his heart, after making a large ugly hole in his side.
Of course he must have been within a few inches of the muzzle,
when his breast, pressing against the string, caused the gun to
go off.</p>

<p>Having again loaded the roer, the hunters returned to their beds.
One might suppose they would have dragged the suicidal hyena
away from the spot, lest his carcass should serve as a warning to his
comrades, and keep them away from the trap. But Swartboy knew
better than that. Instead of being scared by the dead body of one
of their kind, the hyenas only regard it as proper prey, and will
devour it as they would the remains of a tender antelope!</p>

<p>Knowing this, Swartboy did not take the dead hyena away, but
only drew it within the kraal to serve as a farther inducement for
the others to attempt an entrance there.</p>

<p>Before morning they were once more awakened by the &ldquo;bang&rdquo; of
the great gun. This time they lay still; but when day broke they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
visited their trap, and found that a second hyena had too rashly
pressed his bosom against the fatal string.</p>

<p>Night after night they continued their warfare against the hyenas,
changing the trap-kraal to different localities in the surrounding
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>At length these creatures were nearly exterminated, or, at all
events, became so rare and shy, that their presence by the camp was
no longer an annoyance one way or the other.</p>

<p>About this time, however, there appeared another set of visitors,
whose presence was far more to be dreaded, and whose destruction the
hunters were more anxious to accomplish. That was a family of lions.</p>

<p>The spoor of these had been often seen in the neighbourhood; but
it was some time before they began to frequent the camp. However,
about the time the hyenas had been fairly got rid of, the lions took
their place, and came every night, roaring about the camp in a most
terrific manner. Dreadful as these sounds were, the people were not
so much afraid of them as one might imagine. They well knew that
the lions could not get at them in the tree. Had it been leopards
they might have felt less secure, as the latter are true tree-climbers;
but they had seen no leopards in that country, and did not think of
them.</p>

<p>They were not altogether without fear of the lions, however.
They were annoyed, moreover, that they could not with safety descend
from the tree after nightfall, but were every night besieged from
sunset till morning. Besides, although the cow and the quaggas
were shut in strong kraals, they dreaded each night that the lions
would make a seizure of one or other of these animals; and the loss
of any one of them, but especially their valuable friend &ldquo;old Graaf,&rdquo;
would have been a very serious misfortune.</p>

<p>It was resolved, therefore, to try the gun-trap upon the lions, as it
had succeeded so well with the hyenas.</p>

<p>There was no difference in the construction or contrivance of the
trap. The gun only had to be placed upon a higher level, so that its
muzzle might be opposite the lion's heart, and the proper range was
easily obtained. The bait, however, was not carcass, but an animal
freshly killed; and for this purpose an antelope was procured.</p>

<p>The result was as desired. On the first night the old male lion
&ldquo;breasted&rdquo; the fatal string and bit the dust. Next night the lioness
was destroyed in a similar way: and shortly after a full-grown
young male.</p>

<p>The trap then lay idle for a while; but about a week after a half-grown
&ldquo;cub&rdquo; was shot near the camp by Hendrik, no doubt the last
of that family, as no lions were seen for a long time after.</p>

<p>A great enemy to night plunderers was that same gun-trap.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE WEAVER-BIRDS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">N</span>ow that the beasts of prey had been destroyed, or driven from
about the camp, there was no longer any danger in that quarter, and
the children could be left by themselves. Totty of course always
stayed with them; while the four hunters went forth upon the
chase of the elephant&mdash;each mounted upon his quagga.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span></p>

<p>They had done so many a time, and as no harm had happened to
the children in their absence, such a course became habitual with
them. Jan and Tr&uuml;ey were cautioned not to stray far from the
nwana, and always to climb to the tree, should they perceive any
animal that might be dangerous. Before the destruction of the
hyenas and lions, they had been used to remain altogether in the
tree, while the hunters were absent. But this had been quite an
imprisonment to them; and now that the danger was not considered
much, they were allowed to come down and play upon the grassy
plain, or wander along the shore of the little lake.</p>

<p>On one occasion when the hunters were abroad, Tr&uuml;ey had strayed
down to the edge of the water. She was alone, if we except the
company of the gazelle, which followed at her heels wherever she
went. This pretty creature had grown to full size, and had turned
out a great beauty, with large round eyes that had a lovely melting
expression, like the eyes of Tr&uuml;ey herself.</p>

<p>Well, as I have said, Tr&uuml;ey was alone. Jan was busy near the
bottom of the tree, working a new rod into his bird-cage, and Totty
was out upon the plain herding &ldquo;old Graaf&rdquo;&mdash;so Tr&uuml;ey and the pet
springbok went strolling along by themselves.</p>

<p>Now Tr&uuml;ey had not gone down to the water without an object.
She had one. She had gone to give her pet a drink, and collect some
blue lilies for a bouquet. All this she had done, and still continued
to walk along the shore.</p>

<p>On one side of the lake, and that the farthest from the nwana-tree,
a low spit of land projected into the water. It had once been
but a sand-bar, but grass had grown upon it, until a green turf was
formed. There was not over a square perch of it altogether, but it
was not square in shape. On the contrary, it was of oval form, and
much narrower nearest the land, where it formed a neck, or isthmus,
not more than three feet in width. It was, in short, a miniature
peninsula, which by a very little work with the spade could have
been converted into a miniature island&mdash;had that been desired.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing very remarkable about a little peninsula
projecting into a lake. In nearly every lake such a thing may be
seen. But about this one there was something remarkable.</p>

<p>Upon its extreme end grew a tree of singular form and foliage. It
was not a large tree, and its branches drooped downwards until their
tips almost touched the water. The pendulous boughs, and long
lanceolate silvery leaves, rendered it easy to tell what sort of tree it
was. It was the weeping or Babylonian willow&mdash;so called, because
it was upon trees of this species that the captive Jews hung their
harps when they &ldquo;sat and wept by the streams of Babel.&rdquo; This
beautiful tree casts its waving shadow over the streams of South
Africa, as well as those of Assyria; and often is the eye of the
traveller gladdened by the sight of its silvery leaves, as he beholds
them&mdash;sure indications of water&mdash;shining afar over the parched and
thirsty desert. If a Christian, he fails not to remember that highly
poetical passage of sacred writing, that speaks of the willow of
Babylon.</p>

<p>Now the one which grew upon the little peninsula had all these
points of interest for little Tr&uuml;ey&mdash;but it had others as well. Upon
its branches that overhung the water a very singular appearance
presented itself. Upon these was suspended&mdash;one upon the end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
each branch&mdash;a number of odd shaped objects, that hung drooping
down until their lower ends nearly rested upon the surface of the
water. These objects, as stated, were of a peculiar shape. At the
upper ends&mdash;where they were attached to the branches&mdash;they were
globe-shaped, but the lower part consisted of a long cylinder of much
smaller diameter, and at the bottom of this cylinder was the entrance.
They bore some resemblance to salad-oil bottles inverted,
with their necks considerably lengthened; or they might be compared
to the glass retorts seen in the laboratory of the chemist.</p>

<p>They were each twelve or fifteen inches in length, and of a greenish
colour&mdash;nearly as green as the leaves of the tree itself. Were they
its fruit?</p>

<p>No. The weeping willow bears no fruit of that size. They were
not fruit. They were nests of birds!</p>

<p>Yes; they were the nests of a colony of harmless finches of the
genus <i>Ploceus</i>,&mdash;better known to you under the appellation of
&ldquo;weaver-birds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am sure you have heard of weaver-birds before this; and you
know that these creatures are so called on account of the skill which
they exhibit in the construction of their nests. They do not build
nests, as other birds, but actually weave them, in a most ingenious
manner.</p>

<p>You are not to suppose that there is but one species of weaver-bird&mdash;one
kind alone that forms these curious nests. In Africa&mdash;which
is the principal home of these birds&mdash;there are many different
kinds, forming different genera, whose hard names I shall not trouble
you with. Each of these different kinds builds a nest of peculiar
shape, and each chooses a material different from the others. Some,
as the <i>Ploceus icterocephalus</i>, make their nests of a kidney shape, with
the entrance upon the sides, and the latter not circular, but like an
arched doorway. Others of the genus <i>Plocepasser</i> weave their nests
in such a manner, that the thick ends of the stalks stick out all
around the outside, giving them the appearance of suspended hedgehogs;
while the birds of another genus closely allied to the latter,
construct their nests of slender twigs, leaving the ends of these to
project in a similar manner. The &ldquo;social grosbeak&rdquo; fabricates a
republic of nests in one clump, and all under one roof. The entrances
are in the under-surface of this mass, which, occupying the whole
top of a tree, has the appearance of a haystack, or a dense piece of
thatch.</p>

<p>All these weaver-birds, though of different genera, bear a considerable
resemblance to each other in their habits. They are usually
granivorous, though some are insectivorous; and one species, the
&ldquo;red-billed weaver bird&rdquo; is a parasite of the wild buffaloes.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that weaver-birds are only found in
Africa and the Old World, as stated in the works of many naturalists.
In tropical America, birds of this character are found in many
species of the genera <i>Cassicus</i> and <i>Icterus</i>, who weave pensile nests
of a similar kind upon the trees of the Amazon and Orinoco. But
the true weaver-birds&mdash;that is to say, those which are considered the
type of the class,&mdash;are those of the genus <i>Ploceus</i>; and it was a
species of this genus that had hung their pendulous habitations upon
the weeping willow. They were of the species known as the &ldquo;pensile
weaver-bird.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span></p>

<p>There were full twenty of their nests in all, shaped as already
described, and of green colour&mdash;for the tough &ldquo;Bushman's grass,&rdquo;
out of which they had been woven, had not yet lost its verdant hue,
nor would it for a long time. Being of this colour, they actually
looked like something that grew upon the tree,&mdash;like great pear-shaped
fruits. No doubt from this source have been derived the
tales of ancient travellers, who represented that in Africa were trees
with fruits upon them, which, upon being broken open, disclosed to
view either living birds or their eggs!
Now the sight of the weaver-birds, and their nests, was nothing
new to Tr&uuml;ey. It was some time since the colony had established
itself upon the willow-tree, and she and they had grown well acquainted.
She had often visited the birds, had collected seeds, and
carried them down to the tree; and there was not one of the whole
colony that would not have perched upon her wrist or her pretty
white shoulders, or hopped about over her fair locks, without fear.
It was nothing unusual to her to see the pretty creatures playing
about the branches, or entering the long vertical tunnels that led
upward to their nests&mdash;nothing unusual for Tr&uuml;ey to listen for hours
to their sweet twittering, or watch their love-gambols around the
borders of the vley.</p>

<p>She was not thinking of them at the moment, but of something
else, perhaps of the blue water-lilies&mdash;perhaps of the springbok&mdash;but
certainly not of them, as she tripped gaily along the edge of the lake.</p>

<p>Her attention, however, was suddenly attracted to the birds.</p>

<p>All at once, and without any apparent cause, they commenced
screaming and fluttering around the tree, their cries and gestures
betokening a high state of excitement or alarm.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE SPITTING-SNAKE.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">&ldquo;W</span>hat can be the matter with my pretty birds?&rdquo; asked Tr&uuml;ey of
herself. &ldquo;Something wrong surely! I see no hawk. Perhaps they
are fighting among themselves. I shall go round and see. I shall
soon pacify them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so saying she mended her pace; and passing round the end of
the lake, walked out upon the peninsula until she stood under the
willow.</p>

<p>There was no underwood. The tree stood alone upon the very end
of the spit of land, and Tr&uuml;ey went close in to its trunk. Here she
stopped and looked up among the branches, to ascertain what was
causing so much excitement among the birds.</p>

<p>As she approached, several of the little creatures had flown towards
her, and alighted upon her arms and shoulders; but not as was their
wont when desiring to be fed. They appeared to be in a state of alarm,
and had come to her for protection.</p>

<p>Some enemy certainly must be near, thought Tr&uuml;ey, though she
could see none.</p>

<p>She looked around and above. There were no hawks in the air, nor
on the neighbouring trees,&mdash;no birds of prey of any kind. Had there
been one in the willow, she could easily have seen it, as the foliage
was light and thin; besides a hawk would not have remained in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
tree with her standing so near. What, then, caused the trouble among
the birds? what was still causing it&mdash;for they were as noisy and
terrified as ever? Ha! At last the enemy appears&mdash;at last Tr&uuml;ey's
eyes have fallen upon the monster who has disturbed the peaceful
colony of weavers, and roused them to such a pitch of excitement.</p>

<p>Slowly gliding along a horizontal branch, grasping the limb in its
many spiral folds, appeared the body of a large serpent. Its scales
glittered as it moved, and it was the shining of these that had caught
Tr&uuml;ey's eyes, and directed them upon the hideous reptile.</p>

<p>When she first saw it, it was gliding spirally along one of the horizontal
branches of the willow, and coming, as it were, from the nests
of the birds. Her eyes, however, had scarce rested upon it, before its
long slippery body passed from the branch, and the next moment it
was crawling head-foremost down the main trunk of the tree.</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey had scarce time to start back, before its head was opposite
the spot where she had stood. No doubt, had she kept her place she
would have been bitten by the serpent at once; for the reptile, on
reaching that point, detached its head from the tree, spread its jaws
wide open, projected its forked tongue, and hissed horribly. It was
evidently enraged&mdash;partly because it had failed in its plundering intentions,
not having been able to reach the nests of the birds,&mdash;and
partly that the latter had repeatedly struck it with their beaks&mdash;no
doubt causing it considerable pain. It was further provoked by the
arrival of Tr&uuml;ey, in whom it recognised the rescuer of its intended
victims.</p>

<p>Whatever were its thoughts at that moment, it was evidently in a
rage&mdash;as the motion of its head and the flashing of its eyes testified;
and it would have sprung upon any creature that had unfortunately
come its way.</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey, however, had no intention of getting in its way if she could
avoid it. It might be a harmless serpent for all she knew; but a snake,
nearly six feet in length, whether it be harmless or venomous, is a
terrible object to be near; and Tr&uuml;ey had instinctively glided to one
side, and stood off from it as far as the water would allow her.</p>

<p>She would have run back over the narrow isthmus; but something
told her that the snake was about to take that direction, and might
overtake her; and this thought induced her to pass to one side of the
peninsula, in hopes the reptile would follow the path that led out to
the mainland.</p>

<p>Having got close to the water's edge, she stood gazing upon the
hideous form, and trembled as she gazed.</p>

<p>Had Tr&uuml;ey known the character of that reptile, she would have
trembled all the more. She saw before her one of the most venomous
of serpents, the black naja, or &ldquo;spitting-snake&rdquo;&mdash;the cobra of Africa&mdash;far
more dangerous than its congener the <i>cobra de capello</i> of India,
because far more active in its movements, and equally fatal in its bite.</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey knew not this. She only knew that there was a great ugly
snake, nearly twice her own length, with a large open mouth, and
glistening tongue, apparently ready to eat her up. That was fearful
enough for her, poor thing! and she gazed and trembled, and trembled
and gazed again.</p>

<p>Angry as the cobra appeared, it did not turn aside to attack her.
Neither did it remain by the tree. After uttering its long loud hiss,
it descended to the ground, and glided rapidly off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span></p>

<p>It made directly for the isthmus, as if intending to pass it, and retreat
to some bushes that grew at a distance off on the mainland.</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey  was in hopes that such was its design, and was just beginning
to feel safe again, when, all at once, the snake coiled itself upon the
narrow neck of land, as if it intended to stay there.</p>

<p>It had executed this man&#339;uvre so suddenly, and so apparently without
premeditation, that Tr&uuml;ey looked to discover the cause. The
moment before, it was gliding along in rapid retreat, its glistening
form stretched to its full length along the earth. The next instant it
had assumed the appearance of a coiled cable, over the edge of which
projected its fierce head, with the scaly skin of its neck broadly extended,
into that hood-like form which characterises the cobra.</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey, we have said, looked for the cause of this sudden change in
the tactics of the reptile. She learnt it at the first glance.</p>

<p>There stretched a piece of smooth sloping ground from the edge of
the lake back into the plain. By this the little peninsula was approached.
As she glanced outward, she saw the springbok advancing
down this slope. It was the approach of the antelope that had interrupted
the retreat of the serpent!</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey, on first discovering the snake, had uttered a cry of alarm.
This cry had summoned her pet&mdash;that had lingered behind browsing
upon the grass&mdash;and it was now bounding forward, with its white tail
erect, and its large brown eyes glistening with an expression of inquiry.</p>

<p>It saw its mistress out upon the peninsula. Had she called it?
Why had she uttered that strange cry? They were not sounds of joyful
import it had heard. Was anything amiss? Yonder she stood.
It would gallop to her and see what was wanted; and with such
thoughts passing through its brain, the bright little creature bounded
down the bank towards the edge of the lake.</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey trembled for her pet. Another spring, and it would be upon
the lurking serpent&mdash;another&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Ha! it is safe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words escaped from the lips of the young girl, as she saw the
springbok rise high in the air, and leap far and clear over the coiled
reptile. The antelope had observed the snake in time, and saved itself
by one of those tremendous bounds, such as only a springbok can make.
The fond creature, having passed the danger, now ran on to its mistress,
and stood with its big shining eyes bent upon her inquiringly.</p>

<p>But the cry that Tr&uuml;ey had uttered had summoned another individual.
To her horror, she now saw little Jan running down the
slope, and coming directly upon the path where the cobra lay coiled!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE SERPENT-EATER.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">J</span>an's danger was imminent. He was rushing impetuously forward
upon the coiled serpent. He knew not that it was before him. No
warning would reach him in time to stay his haste. In another
moment he would be on the narrow path, and then no power could
save him from the deadly bite. It would be impossible for him to
leap aside or over the reptile, as the antelope had done; for even then
Tr&uuml;ey had noticed that the cobra had darted its long neck several feet
upwards. It would be certain to reach little Jan, perhaps coil itself
around him. Jan would be lost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span></p>

<p>For some moments Tr&uuml;ey was speechless. Terror had robbed her
of the power of speech. She could only scream, and fling her arms
wildly about.</p>

<p>But these demonstrations, instead of warning Jan of the danger,
only rendered it the more certain. He connected the cries which
Tr&uuml;ey now uttered with that which had first summoned him. She
was in some trouble&mdash;he knew not what; but as she continued to
scream, he believed that something had attacked her. A snake he
thought it might be; but whatever it was, his first impulse was to
hurry up to her rescue. He could do no good until close to her; and,
therefore, he did not think of halting until he should reach the spot
where she stood.</p>

<p>Her screams, therefore, and the wild gestures that accompanied
them, only caused him to run the faster; and as his eyes were bent
anxiously on Tr&uuml;ey, there was not the slightest hope that he would
perceive the serpent until he had either trodden upon it, or felt its
fatal bite.</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey uttered one last cry of warning, pronouncing at the same
time the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, brother! back! The snake! the snake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were uttered in vain. Jan heard them, but did not
comprehend their meaning. He heard the word &ldquo;snake.&rdquo; He was
expecting as much. It had attacked Tr&uuml;ey; and although he did not
see it, it was no doubt wound about her body. He hurried on.</p>

<p>Already he was within six paces of the dread reptile, that had
erected its long spread neck to receive him. Another moment, and
its envenomed fangs would pierce deep into his flesh.</p>

<p>With a despairing scream Tr&uuml;ey rushed forward. She hoped to
attract the monster upon herself. She would risk her own life to save
that of her brother!</p>

<p>She had got within six feet of the threatening reptile. Jan was
about the same distance from it on the opposite side. They were
equally in peril; and one or the other&mdash;perhaps both&mdash;would have
fallen a sacrifice to the deadly cobra; but at that moment their
saviour was nigh. A dark shadow passed under their eyes&mdash;in their
ears was a rushing sound like the &ldquo;whish&rdquo; of a falling body&mdash;and at
the same instant a large bird darted down between them!</p>

<p>It did not stay to alight. For a moment its strong broad wings
agitated the air in their faces; but the next moment the bird made
a sudden effort, and rose vertically upwards.</p>

<p>Tr&uuml;ey's eyes fell upon the ground. The cobra was no longer there.</p>

<p>With an exclamation of joy she sprang forward, and, throwing her
arms around Jan, cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are saved, brother!&mdash;we are saved!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jan was somewhat bewildered. As yet he had seen no snake. He
had seen the bird dart down between them; but so adroitly had it
seized the cobra and carried it off, that Jan, looking only at Tr&uuml;ey,
had not perceived the serpent in its beak. He was bewildered and
terrified, for he still fancied that Tr&uuml;ey was in danger.</p>

<p>When he heard her exclaim, &ldquo;We are saved!&rdquo; he was bewildered
all the more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the snake!&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;Where is the snake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he put these questions, he kept examining Tr&uuml;ey from head to foot,
as if expecting to see a reptile twined around some part of her body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The snake, Jan! Did you not see it? It was just there, at our
feet; but now&mdash;see! yonder it is. The secretary has got it. See!
They are fighting! Good bird! I hope it will punish the villain for
trying to rob my pretty weavers. That's it, good bird! Give it to
him! See, Jan! What a fight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ah!&rdquo; said Jan, now comprehending the situation. &ldquo;Oh, ah!
Sure enough, yonder is a snake, and a wopper, too. Ne'er fear, Tr&uuml;ey!
Trust my secretary. He'll give the rascal a taste of his claws. There's
a lick well put in! Another touch like that, and there won't be much
life left in the scaly villain. There again,&mdash;wop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these and similar exclamations the two children stood watching
the fierce conflict that raged between the bird and the reptile.</p>

<p>Now this bird was a very peculiar one&mdash;so much so, that in all the
world there is no other of the same kind. In form it resembled a
crane, having very long legs, and being about the height and size of
a crane. Its head and beak, however, were more like those of an
eagle or vulture. It had well-developed wings, armed with spurs,
and a very long tail, with the two middle feathers longer than the
rest. Its general colour was bluish grey, with a white throat and
breast, and a reddish tinge upon the wing-feathers. But, perhaps,
the most remarkable thing about the bird was its &ldquo;crest.&rdquo; This consisted
of a number of long, blackish plumes growing out of its occiput,
and extending down the back of its neck nearly to the shoulders.
These gave the bird a very peculiar appearance; and the fancied
resemblance to a secretary of the olden time with his long quill
behind his ear&mdash;before steel pens came into fashion&mdash;is the reason
why the bird has received the very inappropriate name of the
&ldquo;Secretary-bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is more properly named the &ldquo;serpent-eater,&rdquo; and naturalists
have given it the title <i>Gypogeranus</i>, or &ldquo;crane-vulture.&rdquo; It is sometimes
also called &ldquo;the messenger,&rdquo; from the staid solemn manner of
its walk, as it stalks over the plain.</p>

<p>Of all its names that of &ldquo;serpent-eater&rdquo; is the best adapted to the
character of the bird. It is true there are other birds that kill and
eat serpents,&mdash;as the &ldquo;guaco&rdquo; bird of South America, and many
hawks and kites,&mdash;but the secretary is the only winged creature that
makes reptiles of this class exclusively its prey, and carries on a
constant war against them. It is not strictly correct to say that it
feeds exclusively upon snakes. It will also eat lizards, tortoises, and
even locusts; but snakes are certainly its favourite food, and to
obtain these it risks its life in many a deadly encounter with those of
a very large kind.</p>

<p>The serpent-eater is an African bird, and is not peculiar to South
Africa alone, as it is found in the Gambia country. It is also a native
of the Philippine Isles. There is some doubt whether the species of
the Philippine Isles is identical with that of Africa. A difference is
noted in the plumage, though very slight. The disposition of the
crest-plumes differs in the two, and the tail-feathers are differently
arranged. In the African species the two middle ones are the longest,
while in the serpent-eater of the Philippines it is the two outside
feathers that project&mdash;giving the bird the appearance of having a
&ldquo;fork&rdquo; or &ldquo;swallow&rdquo; tail. Some points of distinction have also been
observed between the South African bird and that of the Gambia.</p>

<p>The serpent-eater is, however, a very unique bird; and naturalists,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
failing to class it with either hawks, eagles, vultures, gallin&aelig;, or
cranes, have elevated it, so as to form a distinct tribe, family, genus,
and species, of itself.</p>

<p>In South Africa it frequents the great plains and dry karoos, stalking
about in search of its prey. It is not gregarious, but lives solitary
or in pairs, making its nest in trees,&mdash;usually those of a thick thorny
species, which renders the nest most difficult of approach. The whole
edifice is about three feet in diameter, and resembles the nests of the
tree-building eagles. It is usually lined with feathers and down, and
two or three eggs are the number deposited for a single hatching.</p>

<p>The serpent-eater is an excellent runner, and spends more time on
foot than on the wing. It is a shy wary bird, yet, notwithstanding,
it is most easily domesticated; and it is not uncommon to see them
about the houses of the Cape farmers, where they are kept as pets, on
account of their usefulness in destroying snakes, lizards, and other
vermin. They have been long ago introduced into the French West
India Islands, and naturalised there&mdash;in order that they should make
war upon the dangerous &ldquo;yellow serpent,&rdquo; the plague of the plantations
in those parts.</p>

<p>Now the bird which had so opportunely appeared between Jan and
Tr&uuml;ey, and had no doubt saved one or the other, or both, from the
deadly bite of the <i>spuugh-slang</i>, was a serpent-eater,&mdash;one that had
been tamed, and that made its home among the branches of the great
nwana-tree. The hunters had found it upon the plain, wounded by
some animal,&mdash;perhaps a very large snake,&mdash;and had brought it home
as a curiosity. In time it quite recovered from its wounds; but the
kindness it had received, during the period when it was an invalid,
was not thrown away upon it. When it recovered the use of its
wings, it refused to leave the society of its protectors, but remained
habitually in the camp&mdash;although it made frequent excursions into
the surrounding plains in search of its favourite food. It always,
however, returned at night, and roosted among the branches of the
great nwana-tree. Of course it was Jan's pet, and Jan was very good
to it; but it now repaid all his kindness in saving him from the fangs
of the deadly cobra.</p>

<p>The children, having recovered from their alarm, stood watching
the singular conflict between serpent and serpent-eater.</p>

<p>On first seizing the reptile, the bird had caught it by the neck in
its beak. It might not have accomplished this so readily, had not the
attention of the snake been occupied by the children, thus throwing
it off its guard.</p>

<p>Having succeeded in seizing the reptile, the bird rose nearly in
a vertical direction to a height of many yards, and then opening his
beak permitted the serpent to fall to the ground. His object was to
stun the latter by the fall; and the more effectually to do this, he
would have carried the cobra still higher, had not the latter prevented
it by attempting to coil itself around his wings.</p>

<p>Upon letting fall his prey the serpent-eater did not remain in the
air. On the contrary, he darted after the falling reptile, and the
moment the latter touched the ground, and before it could put itself
in an attitude of defence, the bird &ldquo;pounced&rdquo; upon it with spread
foot, striking it a violent blow near the neck. The snake was still
but slightly damaged, and throwing itself into a coil stood upon its
defence. Its mouth was open to its widest extent, its tongue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
protruded, its fangs were erect, and its eyes flashing with rage and
poison. A terrible antagonist it appeared, and for a moment the
secretary seemed to think so, as he stood on the ground confronting
it.</p>

<p>But the bird soon began to advance upon it for a renewal of the
attack, though this advance was made in a cautious manner. With
the pinions of one of his strong wings spread broadly out for a shield,
he approached the reptile sideways, and, when near enough, suddenly
wheeled, turning upon his leg as on a pivot, and struck sharply out
with his other wing. The blow was delivered with good effect. It
reached the head of the snake, and seemed to stun it. Its neck
dropped, the coils became loosened. Before it could recover itself
it was once more in the beak of the serpent-eater, and trailing
through the air.</p>

<p>This time the bird rose to a much greater height than before&mdash;as
he was not hampered by the writhing of the serpent&mdash;and as
before suffered the reptile to fall, and then darted suddenly after.</p>

<p>When the snake came to the ground a second time it lay for a
moment stretched at full length, as if stunned or dead. It was not
dead, however, and would once more have coiled itself; but, before
it could do so, the bird had repeatedly pounced upon its neck with
his spread and horny feet; and at length, watching his opportunity
when the head of the serpent lay flat, he struck a blow with his sharp
beak so violent, that it split the skull of the reptile in twain! Life
was now extinct, and the hideous form, extended to its full length,
lay lithe and motionless upon the grass.</p>

<p>Jan and Tr&uuml;ey clapped their hands, and uttered exclamations of
joy.</p>

<p>The serpent-eater took no heed of their demonstrations, but, approaching
the dead cobra, bent over it, and coolly set about making
his dinner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>

<div class="cap">TOTTY AND THE CHACMAS.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">V</span>on Bloom and his family had now been months without bread.
They were not without a substitute, however, as various roots and
nuts supplied them with a change of food. Of the latter, they had
the ground or pig-nut, which grows in all parts of Southern Africa,
and which forms a staple food of the native inhabitants. For vegetables
they had the bulbs of many species of <i>Ixias</i> and <i>Mesembryanthemums</i>,
among others the &ldquo;Hottentot fig.&rdquo; They had the
&ldquo;Caffir bread&rdquo;&mdash;the inside pith of the stems of a species of <i>Zamia</i>;
and the &ldquo;Caffir chestnut,&rdquo; the fruit of the <i>Brabeium stellatum</i>;
and last, not least, the enormous roots of the &ldquo;elephant's foot.&rdquo; They
had wild onions and garlic too; and in the white flower-tops of
a beautiful floating plant, they found a substitute for asparagus.</p>

<p>All these roots and fruits were to be obtained in the neighbourhood,
and no man knew better how to find them, and &ldquo;crow&rdquo; them up
when found, than did Swartboy the Bushman. Well might he, for
in Swartboy's early days he had often been compelled to subsist for
weeks, and even months, on roots alone!</p>

<p>But although they could procure a constant supply of these natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
productions, they considered them but a poor substitute for bread;
and all of them longed to eat once more what is usually termed the
&ldquo;staff of life&rdquo;&mdash;though in South Africa, where so many people live
exclusively upon the flesh of animals, bread is hardly entitled to that
appellation.</p>

<p>Bread they were likely to have, and soon. When treking from the
old kraal, they had brought with them a small bag of maize. It
was the last of their previous year's stock; and there was not in all
over a bushel of it. But that was enough for seed, and would
produce many bushels if properly planted, and carefully tended.</p>

<p>This had been done shortly after their arrival at their present
home. A fertile spot of ground had been selected, only a few
hundred yards from the nwana-tree. It had been turned up with the
spade, for want of a plough, and the seeds planted at proper distances.</p>

<p>Many an hour had been given to the weeding and hoeing of it, and
around every plant a little hill of soft mould had been raised, to
nourish the roots, and protect them from the heat of the sun. The
plants were even watered now and then.</p>

<p>Partly on account of this attention, and partly from the richness of
the virgin soil, a splendid growth was the result; and the stalks
stood full twelve feet high, with ears nearly a foot long. They had
almost ripened; and the field-cornet intended in about a week or ten
days to gather in the crop.</p>

<p>Both he and all his people were anticipating pleasant feasts of
maize-bread, and &ldquo;hominy,&rdquo; with &ldquo;mash and milk,&rdquo; and various other
dishes, that with Totty's skill could be manufactured out of the
Indian corn.</p>

<p>About this time an incident occurred that nearly deprived them,
not only of their whole plot of maize-plants, but also of their valuable
housekeeper, Totty. It was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Totty was on the platform in the great nwana-tree, which commanded
a view of the corn-patch, and also of the plain beyond, as far
as the bottom of the cliffs. She was busied about &ldquo;house&rdquo; affairs,
when her attention was called off, by some singular noises that came
from that direction. She parted the branches and looked through.
A singular scene was before her eyes&mdash;a spectacle of no common kind.</p>

<p>A body of odd-looking animals, to the number of two hundred or
more, was coming from the direction of the cliffs. They were creatures
of ungainly forms&mdash;in make and size not unlike large ill-shaped dogs&mdash;and
of a greenish-brown colour. Their faces and ears only were
black, and these were naked, while their bodies were covered with
harsh coarse hair. They had long tails, which some of them carried
high in the air, and flourished about in a very eccentric manner.</p>

<p>Totty was by no means alarmed. She knew what sort of animals
they were. She knew they were baboons. They were of the species
known as the &ldquo;pig-faced&rdquo; baboon or &ldquo;chacma&rdquo; (<i>Cynocephalus
porcarius</i>), which is found in nearly every part of South Africa where
there are high cliffs with caves and crevices&mdash;the favourite dwelling-places
of the baboon.</p>

<p>Of all the monkey tribe the baboons, or dog-headed monkeys
(<i>cynocephali</i>), are the most disgusting in form and features. Who
does not feel disgust when regarding the hideous mandrill&mdash;the drill&mdash;the
hamadryas&mdash;or even the chacma? And all these are baboons.
The baboons are peculiar to Africa, and there are six well-known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
species of them:&mdash;the common baboon of North Africa, the &ldquo;papion&rdquo;
of the south and western coast, the &ldquo;hamadryas or tartarin&rdquo; of
Abyssinia, the &ldquo;mandrill&rdquo; and &ldquo;drill&rdquo; of Guinea, and the &ldquo;chacma&rdquo;
of the Cape Colony.</p>

<p>The habits of these animals are as disgusting as their appearance.
They may be tamed, and made &ldquo;pets&rdquo; of; but dangerous pets they
are, as they will, upon, the slightest provocation, bite the hand that
feeds them.</p>

<p>Their great strength of body and jaw, and their long canine teeth,
give them a dangerous power, which they often make use of. No
dog is a match for one, and the hyena and leopard often come off
second best in an encounter with a baboon.</p>

<p>They are not carnivorous, however, and only tear their enemy to
pieces without eating it. Their food consists of fruits and bulbous
roots, which they well understand to dig out of the ground with the
sharp nails of their hands.</p>

<p>Although they will not attack man if left alone, they become
dangerous assailants when hunted and brought to bay.</p>

<p>Many odd stories are told of the chacma baboon among the settlers
of Southern Africa, such as their robbing the traveller of his food,
and then going off to some distance, and mocking him, while they
devour it. The natives also say that they sometimes use a stick in
walking, &ldquo;crowing&rdquo; for roots, and in self-defence. Also, when a
young one has succeeded in finding a choice root, and is observed by
an older and stronger one, that the latter takes it away; but, should
the young one have already swallowed it, then the bully picks him
up, turns him head downward, and shakes him until he is forced to
&ldquo;disgorge!&rdquo; Many such tales are current in the country of the
boers, and they are not all without foundation, for these animals
most certainly possess the power of reflection in a high degree.</p>

<p>Totty from her perch saw enough to convince her of this, had she
been herself inclined to philosophise. But she was not. She was
only a little curious about the man&#339;uvres of the animals, and she
called Tr&uuml;ey and little Jan up into the tree, in order that they might
share the spectacle with her. All the others were off hunting.</p>

<p>Jan was delighted, and ran up the ladder at once. So did Tr&uuml;ey
and all three stood watching the odd movements of the four-handed
creatures.</p>

<p>They perceived that the troop was actually marching in order; not
in line, but with some understood arrangement. There were scouts
upon the wings, and leaders in front. These were baboons of greater
age and size than the others. There were calls and signals, and the
change of accent and tone would have convinced any one that a
regular conversation was going on. The females and younger ones
marched in the middle for better security. The mothers carried
their infants upon their backs, or over their shoulders. Now a
mother would stop to suckle her little offspring&mdash;dressing its hair at
the same time&mdash;and then gallop forward to make up for the loss.
Now one would be seen beating her child, that had in some way
given offence. Now two young females would quarrel, from jealousy
or some other cause, and then a terrible chattering would ensue, to be
silenced by the loud threatening bark of one of the chiefs!</p>

<p>Thus proceeded they across the plain, chattering, and screaming,
and barking, as only monkeys can.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span></p>

<p>What were they after?</p>

<p>That question was answered very soon. Tr&uuml;ey and Jan, and
Totty saw, to their dismay, that the baboons were not out upon an
idle errand. They were after the maize-plants!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/illus-459.jpg" width="348" height="500" alt="TOTTY IN TROUBLE." title="TOTTY IN TROUBLE" />
<span class="caption">TOTTY IN TROUBLE.</span></div>

<p>In a few minutes most of the troop had entered the corn-field, and
were hidden from view by the tall stems and broad leaves of the
plants. A few only could be seen,&mdash;large old fellows, that stationed
themselves outside as sentinels, and were keeping up a constant interchange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
of signals. The main body was already stripping the plants
of their precious fruit.</p>

<p>But a singular appearance presented itself beyond the corn-field,
where a line of baboons, stationed at equal distance from one another,
extended away to the very bottom of the cliff. These had been left
by a regular man&#339;uvre,&mdash;a deployment&mdash;as the troop traversed the
plain in coming to the field. For what purpose?</p>

<p>That was soon apparent. In less than two minutes after the crowd
disappeared under the shelter of the maize-plants, the long heads in
their husks were seen showering out towards the line, as if flung by
the hand of man! Those placed at the near end of the line immediately
took them up, pitched them to the next, and these to the next,
and so on, until, in a very short while from the time a head was
plucked from the stalk, it was delivered to the storehouse of the
baboons far off among the cliffs!</p>

<p>Had this work gone on much longer the field-cornet would have
had but a poor gathering in harvest time. The baboons thought the
corn ripe enough, and would soon have made a crop of it, but at this
moment their operations were interrupted.</p>

<p>Totty knew but little of the danger she underwent, when she ran
forth with nothing but that long broom-handle to drive off a troop
of chacmas. She only thought of the loss her kind master was sustaining;
and down the ladder she hurried, and ran straight out to
the corn-field.</p>

<p>Several sentinels met her by its edge, grinned, chattered, screamed,
barked, and showed their long canine teeth; but they only received
a blow over their ugly snouts from the broom-handle. Their cries
summoned the others; and in a few moments the poor Hottentot
was standing in the midst of an angry circle of chacmas, that were
only prevented from springing in upon her by the expert manner in
which she continued to ply the broom-stick.</p>

<p>But this slight weapon would not have served much longer, and
Totty's fate&mdash;that of being torn to pieces&mdash;would soon have been
sealed, had not four horsemen, or rather &ldquo;quagga-men,&rdquo; at that
moment galloped up to her rescue.</p>

<p>These were the hunters returning from the chase; and a volley
from their guns at once scattered the ugly chacmas, and sent them
howling back to their caves.</p>

<p>After that the field-cornet looked well to his maize, until it was
ready for gathering; when it was all brought home, and deposited
in safety out of the reach of either birds, reptiles, quadrupeds, or
<i>quadrumana</i>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>

<div class="cap">THE WILD HOUNDS AND THE HARTEBEEST.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">S</span>ince the taming of the quaggas the hunting had been attended with
tolerable success. Not a week passed without adding a pair of tusks&mdash;sometimes
two or three pairs&mdash;to the collection, which now began
to assume the form of a little pyramid of ivory standing near the
bottom of the nwana.</p>

<p>Von Bloom, however, was not quite satisfied with his progress.
He thought they might do far better if they had only a few dogs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span></p>

<p>Though the quaggas were of great service to them, and with these
they were often able to overtake the elephant, yet they as often lost
their great game, and it is more easy to do so than most persons
imagine.</p>

<p>But with dogs to join in the hunt, the result would be quite different.
It is true these animals cannot pull down an elephant, nor
do him the slightest injury; but they can follow him whithersoever
he may go, and by their barking bring him to a stand.</p>

<p>Another valuable service which the dogs perform, is in drawing
the attention of the elephant away from the hunters. The huge
quadruped when enraged is, as we have already seen, exceedingly
dangerous. On such occasions he will charge upon the noisy dogs,
mistaking them for his real assailants. This, of course, gives the
hunter a good opportunity of delivering his fire, and avoiding the
deadly encounter of the elephant.</p>

<p>Now in several elephant-hunts which they had lately made, our
hunters had run some very narrow risks. Their quaggas were neither
so manageable nor so quick in their movements as horses would have
been, and this rendered the hazard still greater. Some of them
might one day fall a victim. So feared Von Bloom; and he would
gladly have given for a number of dogs an elephant's tusk a-piece&mdash;even
though they were the most worthless of curs. Indeed, their
quality is but of slight importance. Any dogs that can trace the
elephant and pester him with their barking would do.</p>

<p>Von Bloom even thought of taming some hyenas, and training them
to the hunt. This idea was by no means quixotic. The hyena is often
used for such a purpose, and performs even better than many kinds
of dogs.</p>

<p>One day Von Bloom was pondering over this subject. He was seated
on a little platform that had been constructed very high up&mdash;near the
top of the nwana-tree&mdash;from which a view could be had of the whole
country around. It was a favourite resort of the field-cornet&mdash;his
smoking-room, in fact&mdash;where he went every evening to enjoy a quiet
pull out of his great meerschaum. His face was turned upon the plain
that stretched from the border of the <i>bosch</i> as far as the eye could
reach.</p>

<p>While quietly puffing away, his attention was attracted by some
animals standing at a distance off upon the plain. The brilliant colour
of their bodies had caught his eye.</p>

<p>They were of a lively sienna colour over the back and sides, and
white underneath, with a list of black upon the outside of the legs,
and some black stripes upon the face, as regularly defined as if laid
on by the brush of a painter. They had horns of very irregular shape,
roughly knotted&mdash;each curved into something of the shape of a reaping-hook,
and rising directly from the top of one of the straightest and
longest heads ever carried by an animal. These animals were far from
being gracefully formed. They had drooping hind-quarters like the
giraffe, though in a much less degree, shoulders greatly elevated, and
long narrow heads. For the rest their forms were bony and angular.
Each stood five feet high, from the fore-hoof to the shoulder, and full
nine feet in length.</p>

<p>They were antelopes of course&mdash;that species known among Cape
colonists as the &ldquo;hartebeest.&rdquo; There were in all about fifty of them
in the herd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span></p>

<p>When first observed by Von Bloom, they were quietly browsing
upon the plain. The next moment, however, they were seen to run
to and fro, as if suddenly alarmed by the approach of an enemy.</p>

<p>And an enemy there certainly was; for in a moment more the herd
had taken to flight; and Von Bloom now saw that they were followed
by a pack of hounds! I say a &ldquo;pack of hounds,&rdquo; for the creatures in
the distance exactly resembled hounds more than anything in the
world. Nay, more than resembled, for it actually was a pack of
hounds&mdash;of
wild hounds!</p>

<p>Of course Von Bloom knew what they were. He knew they were
the &ldquo;wilde-honden,&rdquo; very absurdly named by sapient naturalists
<i>Hyena venatica</i> or &ldquo;hunting hyena,&rdquo; and by others, with equal
absurdity the &ldquo;hunting dog.&rdquo; I pronounce these names &ldquo;absurd,&rdquo;
first because the animal in question bears no more resemblance to a
hyena than it does to a hedgehog; and, secondly, because &ldquo;hunting
dog&rdquo; is a very ridiculous appellation, since any dog may merit a similar
title.</p>

<p>Now I would ask, why could these naturalists not let the nomenclature
of the boers alone? If a better name than &ldquo;wilde-honden&rdquo;
(wild hounds) can be given to these animals, I should like to hear it.
Why, it is the very perfection of a name, and exactly expresses the
character of the animal to which they apply it&mdash;that character, which
coming under their everyday observation, suggested the name.</p>

<p>It is quite a libel to call this beautiful creature a hyena. He has
neither the ugly form, the harsh pelage, the dull colour, nor the filthy
habits of one. Call him a &ldquo;wolf,&rdquo; or &ldquo;wild dog,&rdquo; if you please, but he
is at the same time the handsomest wolf or wild dog in creation. But
we shall name him, as the boers have done, a &ldquo;wild hound.&rdquo; That is
his true title, let naturalists class him as they may.</p>

<p>His size, shape, his smooth clean coat, as well as his colour, approximate
him more to the hound than to any other animal. In the last&mdash;which
is a ground of &ldquo;tan&rdquo; blotched and mottled with large spots of
black and grey&mdash;he bears a striking resemblance to the common
hound; and the superior size of his ears would seem to assimilate him
still more to this animal. The ears, however, as in all the wild species
of <i>Canis</i>, are of course not hanging, but erect.</p>

<p>His habits, however, crown the resemblance. In his natural state
the wild hound never prowls alone; but boldly runs down his game,
following it in large organised packs, just as hounds do; and in his
hunting he exhibits as much skill as if he had Tom Moody riding at
his heels, to guide with whip and horn.</p>

<p>It was the field-cornet's good fortune to witness an exhibition of
this skill.</p>

<p>The hounds had come unexpectedly upon the hartebeest herd; and
almost at the first dash, one of the antelopes became separated from
the rest, and ran in an opposite direction. This was just what the
cunning dogs wanted; and the whole pack, instead of following the
herd, turned after the single one, and ran &ldquo;tail on end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now this hartebeest, although an ill-shaped antelope, is one of the
very swiftest of the tribe; and the wild hound does not capture it
without a severe chase. In fact, he could not capture it at all, if speed
were the only point between the two animals. But it is not. The
hartebeest has a weakness in its character, opposite to which the wild
hound possesses a cunning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span></p>

<p>The former when chased, although it runs in a straight line, does
not keep long in a direct course. Now and then it diverges to one
side or the other, led perhaps by the form of the ground, or some other
circumstance. In this habit lies its weakness. The wild hound is
well aware of it, and takes advantage of it by a man&#339;uvre, which
certainly savours strongly of reflection on his part.</p>

<p>Our field-cornet had a proof of this as he watched the chase. His
elevated position gave him a view of the whole ground, and he could
note every movement both of pursuer and pursued.</p>

<p>On breaking off, the hartebeest ran in a right line, and the hounds
followed straight after. They had not gone far, however, when Von
Bloom perceived that one hound was forging ahead of the rest, and
running much faster than any of them. He might have been a swifter
dog than the others, but the hunter did not think it was that. He
appeared rather to be running harder that they, as if sent forward to
push the hartebeest, while the rest saved their wind.</p>

<p>This proved to be really the case; for the dog, by a desperate effort,
having gained upon the antelope, caused the latter to turn slightly
from it original course; and the pack, perceiving this, changed their
direction at the same time, and held along a diagonal line, as if to
head the game. By this means they avoided the d&eacute;tour which both
the antelope and their companion had made.</p>

<p>The hartebeest was now running upon a new line; and as before,
one of the hounds was soon seen to head the pack, and press forward
at the top of his speed. The one that first led, as soon as the antelope
turned from its original course, fell back, rejoined the pack, and was
now lagging among the hindmost! His &ldquo;turn&rdquo; of duty was over.</p>

<p>Again the hartebeest verged from its course. Again the pack ran
obliquely, and made a second &ldquo;cut&rdquo; upon him&mdash;again a fresh dog took
the lead, and on swept the chase as before&mdash;the wild hounds uttering
their yelping notes as they ran.</p>

<p>Several times was this man&#339;uvre executed by the cunning dogs&mdash;until
the desired result was accomplished, and the antelope was completely
&ldquo;blown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, as if they felt that it was in their power, and that further
strategy was not needed, the whole pack rushed forward simultaneously,
and closed rapidly upon the game.</p>

<p>The hartebeest made one last despairing effort to escape, but, finding
that speed would no longer avail, the creature wheeled suddenly round,
and placed itself in an attitude of defiance&mdash;the foam falling from its
lips, while its red eyes sparkled like coals of fire.</p>

<p>In another moment the dogs were around it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a splendid pack!&rdquo; exclaimed Von Bloom. &ldquo;Oh! that I had
such an one!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he continued, as a new thought struck him, &ldquo;and why not,
just such an one?&mdash;why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the train of reflections that passed through the mind of the
field-cornet was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>That the wild hounds might be tamed, and trained to hunting,&mdash;easiest
of all, to the chase of the elephant. He knew that this could
be done, for boer-hunters had often done it. True, the dogs must be
taken young, but where were young ones to be obtained? It is not
so easy to capture the pups of the wild hound. Until they are able to
run well, their mothers do not permit them to stray far from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
caves in which they are littered; and these are usually crevices among
rocks quite inaccessible to man. How could he obtain a set of them?
He had already formed such an intention. Where could be their
breeding place?</p>

<p>His reflections were interrupted at this point, by very singular
behaviour on the part of the wild hounds, and which gave him a new
idea of their intelligence that quite electrified him.</p>

<p>When the hartebeest stood to bay, and the hounds came up, Von
Bloom very naturally expected to see the latter run in upon their
game, and at once pull it to the ground. This he knew was their
usual habit. What was his astonishment at seeing the whole pack
standing off to one side, as if they intended to leave the antelope alone!
Some of them even lay down to rest themselves, while the others
stood with open jaws and lolling tongues, but without showing any
signs that they intended further to molest the panting quarry!</p>

<p>The field-cornet could observe the situation well, for the antelope
was on his side&mdash;that is, towards the cliffs&mdash;while the dogs were
farther out upon the plain. Another circumstance that astonished
him was, that the dogs, after running up and around the hartebeest,
had actually drawn off to their present position!</p>

<p>What could it mean? Were they afraid of its ugly horns? Were
they resting themselves before they should make their bloody onslaught!</p>

<p>The hunter kept his gaze intently fixed upon the interesting
group.</p>

<p>After a while the antelope, having recovered its wind a little, and
seeing the pack so distant, made a fresh start.</p>

<p>This time it ran in a side direction, apparently with the intention
of gaining a hill that lay in that way, and up the sides of which it no
doubt calculated upon gaining some advantage. But the creature
had hardly stretched itself, when the hounds struck out after it; and
in five hundred yards running, once more brought it to a stand.
Again the pack took station at a distance, and the hartebeest stood
upon the plain alone!</p>

<p>Once more it essayed to escape, and started off with all the speed
that was left in its legs&mdash;the hounds as before trooping after.</p>

<p>This time the antelope headed in a new direction, making for a
point in the cliffs; and as the chase now passed very near to the
nwana-tree, everybody had a fine view of it.</p>

<p>The hartebeest seemed to be going faster than ever, or, at all events,
the dogs did not now appear to gain upon it; and the field-cornet, as
well as all the young people, were in hopes the poor creature would
escape from its tireless pursuers.</p>

<p>They watched the chase, until they could just see the bright body
of the hartebeest afar off, appearing like a yellow spot upon the face
of the rocks, but the dogs were no longer visible. Then the yellow
spot suddenly disappeared like the going out of a candle, and they
could see it no more.</p>

<p>No doubt the antelope was pulled down!</p>

<p>A strange suspicion entered the mind of Von Bloom, and, calling
upon them to saddle the quaggas, he, with Hans and Hendrik, rode
off towards the place where the hartebeests had been last seen.</p>

<p>They approached the ground with caution; and under the shelter
of some bushes were enabled to get within two hundred yards of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
spot without being observed. A singular spectacle rewarded their
pains.</p>

<p>Within a dozen yards of the cliff lay the body of the hartebeest,
where it had been &ldquo;pulled down&rdquo; by the dogs. It was already half
eaten, not by the hounds that had hunted it, but by their puppies of
all ages, that to the number of more than threescore were now standing
around the carcass, tugging away at its flesh and snarling at one
another! Some of the grown dogs that had taken part in the chase
could be seen lying upon the ground, still panting after their hard
run; but most of them had disappeared, no doubt into the numerous
small caves and crevices that opened along the bottom of the cliffs.</p>

<p>There was no room left to doubt the singular fact&mdash;that the wild
hounds had regularly driven the hartebeest up to their breeding-place
to feed their young, and that they had abstained from killing it out
upon the plain to save themselves the labour of dragging it from a
distance!</p>

<p>Indeed these animals&mdash;unlike the <i>Felid&aelig;</i>&mdash;have not the power of
transporting a large mass to any considerable distance; hence the
wonderful instinct which led them to guide the antelope to the very
spot where its flesh was wanted!</p>

<p>That they were in the constant practice of this singular habit was
attested, by the numerous bones and horns of large antelopes of
different kinds, that lay strewed around the place.</p>

<p>Von Bloom had his eye upon the young puppies, and all three made
a rush towards them. But it was to no purpose. Cunning as their
fathers and mothers, the little fellows forsook their meal at first sight
of the intruders, and darted off into their caves!</p>

<p>But they were not cunning enough to escape the snares, which were
laid for them every day for a week after; and, before the end of that
time, more than a dozen of them were safely domiciled in a little
kennel built especially for their use, under the shadow of the great
nwana-tree.</p>

<p>In less that six months from that time, several of them were in the
field, and trained to the chase of the elephant, which duty they
performed with all the courage and skill that could have been shown
by hounds of the purest breed!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>

<div class="cap">CONCLUSION.</div>
<br />

<p class="noindent"><span class="first">F</span>or several years Von Bloom led the life of an elephant-hunter. For
several years the great nwana-tree was his home, and his only companions
his children and domestics. But, perhaps, these were not the
least happy years of his existence, since, during all the time both he
and his family had enjoyed the most estimable of earthly blessings,&mdash;health.</p>

<p>He had not allowed his children to grow up without instruction.
He had not permitted them to lapse into the character of mere &ldquo;Bush-boys.&rdquo;
He had taught them many things from the book of nature,&mdash;many
arts that can be acquired as well on the karoo as in the college.
He had taught them to love God, and to love one another. He had
planted in their minds the seeds of the virtuous principles,&mdash;honour
and morality,&mdash;without which all education is worthless. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
imbued them with habits of industry and self-reliance, and had initiated
them into many of the accomplishments of civilised life&mdash;so that
upon their return to society they might be quite equal to its claims.
Upon the whole, those years of the exile's life, spent in his wilderness
home, formed no blank in his existence. He might look back upon
them with feelings of satisfaction and pleasure.</p>

<p>Man, however, is formed for society. The human heart, properly
organised, seeks communion with the human heart; and the mind,
especially when refined and polished by education, loves the intercourse
of social life, and, when deprived of it, will always yearn to
obtain it.</p>

<p>So was it with the field-cornet. He desired to return once more
within the pale of civilised society. He desired once more to revisit
the scenes where he had so long dwelt in peaceful happiness; he
desired once more to establish himself among his friends and acquaintances
of former days, in the picturesque district in the Graaf Reinet.
Indeed, to have remained any longer in his wilderness home could
have served no purpose. It is true he had grown very much attached
to his wild hunter-life, but it was no longer likely to be profitable.
The elephants had completely forsaken the neighbourhood of the
camp, and not one was to be found within twenty miles of the spot.
They had become well-acquainted with the report of the long roer,
and knew the dangerous character of that weapon; they had learnt
that of all their enemies man was the one to be especially dreaded
and shunned; and they had grown so shy of his presence, that the
hunters frequently passed whole weeks without setting their eyes
upon a single elephant.</p>

<p>But this was no longer an object of solicitude with Von Bloom.
Other considerations now occupied his mind, and he did not care
much if he should never spoor another of these huge quadrupeds.
To return to the Graaf Reinet, and settle there, was now the ultimatum
of his wishes.</p>

<p>The time had at length arrived when he would be able to carry out
that design; and nothing seemed any longer to stand in the way of
its full and complete accomplishment.</p>

<p>The proscription against him had been long since taken off. A
general amnesty had been passed by the government, and he had
been pardoned among the rest.</p>

<p>It is true his property was not restored to him; but that mattered
little now. He had created a new property, as was testified by the
vast pyramid of ivory that stood under the shadow of the great
nwana-tree!</p>

<p>Nothing remained but to transport this shining pile to a market,
and a splendid fortune would be the result.</p>

<p>And Von Bloom's ingenuity found the means for bringing it to
market.</p>

<p>About this time there was dug another huge pit-trap near the
pass in the cliffs, in which many quaggas were trapped; and then,
there were stirring scenes, while these wild creatures were being
broken to harness, and trained to &ldquo;trek&rdquo; in a wagon.</p>

<p>They were trained, however, after a good deal of trouble&mdash;the old
wheels, still in prime condition, serving as the &ldquo;break;&rdquo; and then
the body of the wagon was let down from the tree, and once more
renewed its acquaintance with its old companions the wheels; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
the cap-tent spread its protecting shadow over all; and the white and
yellow crescents were stowed; and the quaggas were &ldquo;inspanned;&rdquo;
and Swartboy, mounting the &ldquo;voor-kist,&rdquo; once more cracked his long
bamboo whip; and the wheels, well oiled with elephants' grease,
again whirled gaily along!</p>

<p>How surprised were the good people of Graaf Beinet, when one
morning a cap-tent wagon, drawn by twelve quaggas, and followed
by four riders mounted upon animals of the same kind, pulled up in
the public square of their little town! How astonished they were
on seeing that this wagon was &ldquo;chuck&rdquo; full of elephants' teeth, all
except a little corner occupied by a beautiful girl with cherry cheeks
and fair flaxen hair; and how joyed were they, in fine, on learning
that the owner of both the ivory and the beautiful girl was no other
than their old friend, and much-esteemed fellow-citizen, the field-cornet,
Von Bloom!</p>

<p>A warm welcome met the elephant-hunter in the square of Graaf
Reinet, and, what was also of some importance, a ready market for
his ivory.</p>

<p>It chanced just at that time that ivory was selling at a very high
rate. Some article&mdash;I do not remember what&mdash;the principal part of
which required to be constructed of pure ivory, had come into fashion
and general use in European countries, and the consequence was an
increased demand for this valuable commodity. It was a fortunate
circumstance for the returned hunter, who was at once enabled to
dispose of his stock, not only for ready money, but at such a fine
price as to yield him nearly twice the amount he had calculated on
receiving!</p>

<p>He had not brought it all with him, as there was more than would
have loaded any one wagon. A second load had remained, hidden
near the nwana-tree, and this required a journey to be made for it.</p>

<p>It was made in due time, and the remainder arrived safely at Graaf
Reinet, and was there delivered to the ivory-dealers, who had already
purchased it.</p>

<p>The result was a splendid fortune in ready money. The field-cornet
was once more a rich man!</p>

<p>For the present we can follow his history no farther than to say,
that the proceeds of his great hunt enabled him to buy back his old
estate, and to stock it in splendid style, with the best breeds of
horses, horned cattle, and sheep; that he rose rapidly in wealth and
worldly esteem; that the government gave him its confidence; and,
having first restored him to his old office of field-cornet, soon afterwards
promoted him to that of &ldquo;landdrost,&rdquo; or chief magistrate of
the district.</p>

<p>Hans returned to his college studies; while the dashing Hendrik
was enabled to enter the profession for which he was most fit, and
the very one that fitted him, by obtaining a cornetcy in the &ldquo;Cape
Mounted Rifles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Jan was packed off to school to study grammar and geography;
while the beautiful Tr&uuml;ey remained at home to grace the
mansion of her honoured father, and look after his household affairs.</p>

<p>Totty still ruled the kitchen; and, of course, Swartboy was the
important man about the house, and for many a long year after
cracked his great whip, and flourished his jambok among the long-horned
oxen of the wealthy landdrost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span></p>

<p>But enough for the present,&mdash;enough of adventure for one year.
Let us hope, boy readers, that before you and I have circled once
more around the sun, we shall make a fresh trip to the land of the
boers, and again encounter the worthy Von Bloom, his Bushman, and&mdash;</p>
